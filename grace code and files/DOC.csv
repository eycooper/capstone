201,0,Begin simulation.
201,1,Good morning class. I'm Ms. Tachi. How are you all today?
201,2,"Good teacher. Good, good,"
201,3,"Good. That's good to hear. So today we're gonna go over and review just three expectations that we should have during small groups. So one is raise your hand if you would like to share. So can you, can I see what raising your hand looks like? So,"
201,4,"Um,"
201,5,"Yeah. Good. Emily, Carlos, you guys Nice. So when we wanna share our thought, so you raise our hand so then we can, um, the others can share and listen. Nina up here please. Okay, thank you. Our second expec, uh, expectation is to be active listeners. So when we're listening to others, we should be using our ears and listening and engaging to what others are saying. Just how if someone is sharing, you'd want them to be respectful to yours, which goes into our last expectation is to be respectful, respectful to others, and to yourself and to me when in small group. So do you guys have any questions about any expectations or if you wanna add any more expectations we should have for a small group. Emily, is everything alright?"
201,6,"Yeah, I got text from my mom. Um, I have, um, sorry Emily, but I have a lot of ideas about, um, classrooms that we could, um, you do for once now overnight we can change em up."
201,7,"Okay. Um, Emily, um, after small group, we can talk about, um, whatever's going on with you. Um, if that's all,"
201,8,Sorry.
201,9,"No worries. Yeah, we can talk about it. Um, Carlos, did you have any ideas? You're trouble, Nina,"
201,10,"You,"
201,11,"Um, so Carlos wants to share and one of our ex uh, expectation is to be active listeners. So when others are talking, we wanna hear what they have to say all after class. You guys can talk about that all. Hi Carlos. Would uh, what would you like to share?"
201,12,"Just, um, we could come up with some new forms for after the break. That one we had before break, but, um, yeah, but now, um, we could come up with some different ones. Like, like could we get up and stretch at certain times during the day that copy one of our norms?"
201,13,Oh yeah. That's a great idea. I I love an idea of having like a brain break and stretching and having our body ready. We're
201,14,"Ready. Um, are we doing that today?"
201,15,"Yeah, of course. Um, after small group we can talk about that. Uh, maybe during lunch."
201,16,"Okay. Okay. That's good. Okay. Cause I just wanted to make sure that, um, I'm work with the brain project. Yeah, of course. Guys, are you doing, um, science for projects?"
201,17,"Yeah. And if anyone else wants to go over science fair stuff, just let me know and I can, we can meet together."
201,18,"Alright. Okay, good."
201,19,"Uh, so can someone share one of the expectations that we talked about today during small group?"
201,20,Be kind.
201,21,"Be kind as one. Yeah, that could be for the active listeners. When we're listening to others"
201,22,"Boring, why are we doing this?"
201,23,"Well, we have to make sure that we know our expectations with, um, each other. So then when we're sharing and discussing during small group, then we know what the"
201,24,"Expectation,"
201,25,"I know I sound boring, but it's good to go over them. Jayla. Um, so are, the expectation is to raise your hand and your li uh, you wanna share the active listeners and Jayla said, be kind, which is part of being a active listener. And"
201,26,"Be respectful. My suggestions. Will you shut, I'm so tired of to this. You're not. My mother"
201,27,Will be kind to each other please.
201,28,Sorry. Just trying to help.
201,29,"Uh, so come,"
201,30,Leave me alone.
201,31,"I understand, but I understand that you feel frustrated right now. But"
201,32,"I'm angry. Yeah,"
201,33,I can tell that you're angry. Take some breathe and calm your body.
201,34,"Yeah, there you go. Thanks. Teacher"
201,35,And simulation.
202,0,"Okay, go ahead."
202,1,Okay.
202,2,And stop simulation.
202,3,"Hi. Good morning, class. How are you guys?"
202,4,Hi teacher.
202,5,"Hi. Um, I'm Ms. Martin. Um, and today that we, we are gonna be going over just some behavioral expectations for our class. I know it's like the first week of school here. And so I just want us to kind of start off with some ground, um, expectations of what to kind of, uh, go over while we are learning throughout this year. Um, so does it, can anybody raise their hand and tell me, um, any type of classroom expectations they've maybe had in past"
202,6,Your science project
202,7,Together
202,8,Yet? Cause you should really
202,9,Start. Are we?
202,10,I didn't have our science.
202,11,"Hi, will and Nina. Hi. Can you tell me, can you raise your hand and tell me, um, what type of classroom expectations you've had in the past will, have you had any classroom expectations in the past? Maybe some rules that teachers have gone over with you in the past? Um,"
202,12,"Yeah,"
202,13,"I mean, we, uh, we can raise your hand and stuff."
202,14,"Yeah. Does anybody else have any ideas of, um, what they would like to see as our classroom expectations for this year?"
202,15,Text Carlo. Hi mom. It's my mom. Text.
202,16,"One of the classroom rules that I would like to see from you guys is respecting others, and that can mean active listening. So as teachers are talking, um, I'd like to make sure that we're all active. Listen, like Jayla a great job."
202,17,"I wanted to get, cause we, um, I remember all the, from last year and I can give you a whole list of everything. Mm-hmm."
202,18,"<affirmative>, do you have one that you specifically guys"
202,19,"And, um, come to class?"
202,20,"Yeah,"
202,21,"I mean, I can give you the whole list. Do you want the"
202,22,"Whole list? That's okay right now. I like that one. So another one coming to class prepared. So coming to class prepared and making sure that you, um, are ready to learn and are showing respect to your classmates. Um, and then another one that I also like, um, is to make sure that we are, um, listening to our classmates as they're sharing their experiences or sharing their, um, their work with you and making sure that we're not, um, talking over the teacher as your Mina. What were some of my classroom rules?"
202,23,"I think you said like, um, I don't remember. I'm"
202,24,"Talking to her. I know. So that's gonna be one of the, as well too, is making sure that we're listening to the teacher, um, eyes are on the teacher. That's part of our respect. Um, respecting the teacher and making sure that we're listening when, um, others are talking. So that's not even just me as a teacher, but also"
202,25,We're gonna talk about the science fair. I really wanna present my topic to you. I wanna make sure it's okay. So I can you start on
202,26,"Carlos? We can, we can do that later for sure, but right now we're going over just some classroom expectations."
202,27,Right? Okay. But I wanna talk about my topic.
202,28,"We can do that later. Carlos does, does that work for you? Okay. We'll do it after this. Okay. Okay. So we had respecting others, listening to others, and then, um, making sure that we're coming to class prepared. Um, does anybody have any other classroom expectations that they'd like to add to that list? Yes. Mina, thank you for raising your hand. Be kind. Is that what you're saying? Yeah. I really do like that one as well too. Um, that can also go under respecting others. So we're respecting others by being kind and listening. This"
202,29,Is boring. Why are we doing this?
202,30,"And then also making sure that we're not, um, we're not talking out loud when the teacher is talking. Jayla, do you think that that is a respectful behavior to make to say that, um, that this is kind boring"
202,31,About my science fair picture? I'm gonna tell the principal
202,32,That project you
202,33,"Nina, eyes up here."
202,34,Oh my gosh.
202,35,Shell
202,36,Not be quiet. And she keeps bothering my science fair.
202,37,"I know. I'm, that's a really"
202,38,Good topic for him. And he'll
202,39,"Listen, <laugh>. I know, but right now we're not talking about our science fair projects. We'll talk about our science fair projects later. Okay. Right now we, right now we're doing our classroom expectations and we've got our three classroom rules. Um, so making sure that we are creating that positive environment, um, that's what I'd like to, to do here. So let's all, uh, make sure that we're listening. So we're doing our active listening. So what are some good examples of active list? Okay. And."
203,0,And start simulation.
203,1,"Hello, class. So today we're gonna be going over our, um, three rules for our class, our three expectations for our class today."
203,2,"I like, thank you"
203,3,"So much. It's new. All right, so let's go to our first expectation. Our first expectation is being respectful. So I wanted to ask you guys, what does that look like? What does being respectful look like in our classroom? Does anybody have any idea?"
203,4,Looks like this
203,5,"Looks like this. Well, listening. Yeah. Being respectful. Being part of being respectful is listening. Right? What else does being respectful look like or sound like?"
203,6,"Um,"
203,7,Anybody have any a ideas?
203,8,Quiet.
203,9,"Quiet. Sometimes it's being quiet. Other times it's participating in giving your voice, right? Well,"
203,10,"I think that, um, you better start working on your, you. Well, I mean, I well, you"
203,11,"Can we guys, can we finish this conversation after class? Maybe? Thank you. Well, that was a very respectful way to tell Meina to pay attention. I like that. All right, so, so being respectful, who are we being respectful towards? Anybody have any ideas?"
203,12,"Oh no. Oh, I got a text."
203,13,"We got a text. We shouldn't have your phone with you. That's not part of being respectful, right?"
203,14,"Yeah. Oh, um, yeah, it was my"
203,15,"Mom. Oh, sorry. Oh, it's okay. So Emily, what is, um, who should we be respectful towards? Who are people that we should be respectful towards?"
203,16,"Um, our"
203,17,"Classmates. Our classmates, right? Who else?"
203,18,"Oh, I have a lot of I ideas about classroom norms. I can give you a whole list from last chair if you wanted. Teacher, um, do you want me to start listing them for you? Um, I know"
203,19,"My heart. Let's just keep going with our classroom norms that we have said already. So number two, let's move on. Number two, our second classroom norm is try your hardest. What does that mean? What does that look like? Anybody have any idea of what trying your hardest looks like? Jayla, thank you for raising your hand."
203,20,"Uh, it means, um, I'm doing all the work that you're asked to do and even if you don't wanna,"
203,21,Sometimes it looks like that. What else does trying your hardest look like? Anybody have any idea?
203,22,Stop talking to me about this. Shut up. I have a really good topic for you. Nina will
203,23,Have
203,24,Time with clients.
203,25,They'll shut
203,26,Up. Nina
203,27,Will. Was there a nicer way to ask Nina to be quiet? Maybe.
203,28,I
203,29,Dunno. She more respectful.
203,30,Love about
203,31,This.
203,32,She's nagging me about my science project. She's trying to help.
203,33,"I understand that's frustrating. Will, but there's also more respectful way you can tell somebody to stop talking to you. What do you think that is? What's a spec respectful way to do"
203,34,That? Just ignore her.
203,35,"Ignore her. Maybe. I don't know if that would work. Maybe just asking her to be quiet and then if that doesn't work, maybe asking me to help. What about that?"
203,36,"Please be quiet. Mina. Yeah. Yeah, that would"
203,37,"Work. I like that. Alright, so try"
203,38,The science fair. I'd like to my topic with you teacher. Can we talk about the science fair
203,39,"Now? You know, it would be a great time to do that at recess. How about that, Carlos?"
203,40,"Oh, okay. All right. I have a good topic. I wanna make sure you"
203,41,"Have program. Okay, we'll talk about it at recess. All right. So trying your hardest. I have a question for you guys. Does trying your hardest look the same for everybody? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? No. That's right. So it's kind of dependent on who you are as a person, right? So trying your hardest could look like you're talking a lot and you're interjecting into the discussion. But for some people, that's really hard for them. And maybe saying one thing is trying their hardest in the discussion, right?"
203,42,"Right,"
203,43,"Right. All right, so let's move on to our third, um, expectation. Our third expectation is being responsible. What is being responsible? Oh"
203,44,My gosh. Why are we doing this? This is so boring.
203,45,"Well, we wanna come over our class expectations multiple times throughout the year so you guys are aware of them. And so we can maybe update them and we think that they're not working. So being responsible is our third expectation. So what does that mean for you guys? What does that mean for you, Jayla? Being responsible."
203,46,"Um, doing what you say to do. Everybody else has to do it too. Anybody? Same page."
203,47,Does anybody have any other ideas of what being responsible means? Do you guys agree with Jayla?
203,48,"If you do not stop talking. I'm gonna take this to teacher. Well, science there for the last time. Shut up."
203,49,"Okay. Well, remember when we talked about being respectful and our first expectation?"
203,50,Okay. What about her being respectful of
203,51,"Me? Well, part of being respectful also is not talking when other people are talking, right? Nina? Yeah. Yeah. That's kind disrespectful. Thank you for apologizing. All right, so being responsible. What do you guys, what else do you guys think being responsible means?"
203,52,"Um, bringing your homework."
203,53,Great. That's one way to be responsible and.
204,0,And start simulation.
204,1,Hi class. My name is Clarissa.
204,2,Hey Clarissa.
204,3,Hello. How are you all doing today?
204,4,Good.
204,5,"Good, good. Okay. So first we are going to review some expectations today. Can anyone remind me of an expectation we have for our classroom?"
204,6,I got
204,7,"One. Yeah, Jayla, go ahead."
204,8,Gotta raise your hand before you talk.
204,9,Gotta raise your hand before you talk. That's a great one. I appreciate that. You just exemplified that right now. When you were thinking of something to say and raised your hand first everyone show me what it looks like to raise your hand.
204,10,"Okay. So if you wanna,"
204,11,"Hey,"
204,12,"I'll, yeah,"
204,13,Can you show me what it looks like? Raise. Raise
204,14,Your hand. Hi.
204,15,What's that?
204,16,Can you think of an expectation we have for our class?
204,17,We're talking when the teacher's
204,18,Talking. That's a good one. Will do you remember that one also?
204,19,"Oh,"
204,20,I appreciate that Carlos has been sitting silently this whole time while we've been talking. So you're right. We have raise your hand when you'd like to talk
204,21,Text.
204,22,"Emily, do you have an idea of a one more, um, expectation we have."
204,23,"Oh, I can tell you all the norms for, um, the whole year teacher. Cause I remember our list from last year. Do you want me to go through them? Um, it was, yeah,"
204,24,Let's see if Emily has an idea and maybe she can phone a friend if she can't think of
204,25,Anything.
204,26,How prepared for class.
204,27,"That is an awesome one. So we have raise your hand when you'd like to speak. Don't talk when the teacher's talking and come prepared for class. Those are awesome. Carlos, did you have anything you wanted to add to that?"
204,28,Okay.
204,29,Excuse me. Mi
204,30,"No, you shut up. I'm so tired of"
204,31,Him. Will and Mina eyes on me please.
204,32,Trying help.
204,33,"Geez,"
204,34,"Mina and will help eyes on me. So will, I appreciate that you're trying to pay attention, but I don't like the way you talk to Mina right now. Oh, and Mina,"
204,35,You should be talking to me.
204,36,You're right. Mina. Let's remember that the expectation we just talked about. Not talking while the teacher's talking.
204,37,Okay. Sorry.
204,38,"That's okay. Thank you very much. All right. So that was a good review. Does anyone wanna show me, um, with their hand in the air?"
204,39,"So I wanna make sure that my science project is okay. So, um, can I present my topic to you right now so I can get going on? Got it. Recess?"
204,40,"Yeah, we just talked about how we wanna raise our hand when we have something to say. So I'm wondering what you all did this weekend, but if you'd like to share, I'd like you to show me what we just talked about and it raise your hand if you'd like to speak. Does anyone wanna share what they did this weekend? No. Will go ahead."
204,41,"Yeah, I watched Sam the basketball game on TV with my dad."
204,42,That sounds very fun. Thank you for raising your hand. Anybody else? Nina?
204,43,"Um, I worked on fair project."
204,44,You worked on your science fair project.
204,45,This is boring. Why are we doing this?
204,46,Jayla?
204,47,Yeah.
204,48,"I'm gonna remind you of one more expectation that we didn't talk about, which is to show respect to our classmates. So how about we listen to Mina right now and we'll move on in just a little bit. All that's okay. Thank you very much. Mina, what's your project about? Well, um,"
204,49,"Hey. Ok, so if you don't you be talking to the teacher right now. Not me. I just write down You'll this weekend. I did not watch you at my house. Do not come to my house."
204,50,Will tired
204,51,"Of you talking to me about this? Well,"
204,52,"I mean, just stop Nina eyes on me please. I would like you to,"
204,53,I'm Oh
204,54,"My gosh, I appreciate that you're wanting to help. Will, but I don't think Will wants help right now, so I'd like you to please stop talking to Will."
204,55,Okay. Teacher.
204,56,"Thank you. And, and simulation."
205,0,And start simulation.
205,1,"Okay. Hey guys. Um,"
205,2,Hey teacher.
205,3,How are you guys doing today?
205,4,Good.
205,5,"Good. So today we are going to review, um, some of our behavioral expectations in our classroom. Who can tell me one of the expectations that we have in class? Jayla, do you have any ideas?"
205,6,"But, um, well, I can your science if you just listen. I don't need your help. So,"
205,7,"Hey, Nina and Will. Sure. Do you have any ideas of behavioral expectations for the class?"
205,8,"Um, no talking when the teacher's talking."
205,9,That's a great expectation. Why don't we talk when the teacher's talking?
205,10,Because then everybody can't hear people get interrupted and stuff.
205,11,"Right? Should you be talking when your peers are sharing? No. No. Right? Because everybody should feel that their voice can be heard, right?"
205,12,"Oh,"
205,13,Huh.
205,14,I had a text. No.
205,15,"Okay. Emily, what's another rule that we could use in our classroom?"
205,16,"Sorry, I just got a text from my mom."
205,17,Okay. Would you mind putting your phone away please?
205,18,Sure. Sorry.
205,19,Thank you.
205,20,"Um,"
205,21,"Um,"
205,22,"People should come to class prepared,"
205,23,Come to pla class prepared. What do we need to be prepared in
205,24,"Class? Well, I can tell you all about that. I mean, I come to class prepared every day and, um, I know all the norms for what we're gonna do this year. I can give you a whole list of 'em. Do you want me to go over 'em with you?"
205,25,Carlos? What are three things that you need to bring to class every day to be prepared?
205,26,"Um, yourself. Okay. Your notebook, homework and your planner."
205,27,Those are great things. Do you need to have a positive attitude when you come to class?
205,28,"Yes, ma'am."
205,29,"Right. Because learning is fun and sometimes it's hard, but if we have positive attitude, we can get through it, right? All together, right? Jayla, do you have any new ideas of what Another behavioral expectation"
205,30,Classroom? Shut up. Mina. I'm not what you want me to
205,31,"Do. Will Mina please focus your eyes on me? Will eyes on you please. Thank you. Jayla, do you have any ideas?"
205,32,"Um, for a classroom? No."
205,33,Yes. Behavioral expectations?
205,34,"Um, everybody's gotta be kind."
205,35,"Everybody should be kind. What are the, should we be kind to each other?"
205,36,Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. What
205,37,About to ourselves
205,38,"Meant? Yeah. Oh,"
205,39,And what about to the things in our classroom? Should we be kind to our materials and take care of our things?
205,40,Yeah. Don't write on the desks. Don't put gum under the desk. Somebody always puts gum under the
205,41,"Desk, right? Don't put your gum under the desk. Don't write on the desks. Take care of of your books. Don't draw on them. Right? Make sure we put things back where they belong so that we can use them for the whole year. Can"
205,42,"We talk about my science fair project Now? Um, teacher, I wanna run my, uh, topic by you and make sure that it's okay so I can get started. Recess."
205,43,"Yeah. Carlos, I'd love to talk with you about that right before recess. Can talk one on one, okay?"
205,44,What?
205,45,"We can talk. Just me and you. Okay. Would that be good? Well, in a couple minutes once we go to recess, okay. Okay. Okay. Awesome. Mina, do you have anything else to add? Any other behavioral expectations? What is it?"
205,46,Raise?
205,47,Talk. Talk. You should raise your hand before you talk. Why is that?
205,48,Everybody gets a turn.
205,49,"Does everybody gets a turn? Right? So kind of like going back to what Will was saying about not talking over other people, right? Not talking when somebody"
205,50,Else is talking. This is boring. Why are we doing this?
205,51,"So, Jayla, we have to review our behavioral expectations because lately we haven't been listening in class and following the rules that we said at the beginning of the year. So right now we're gonna review them so that way we can move forward as a responsible, respectful classroom."
205,52,Okie dokey
205,53,"Teacher, do you agree with that?"
205,54,"Yes, ma'am."
205,55,Awesome. Does anyone have anything else to add about expectations that we have in our classroom trip?
205,56,"Okay, if"
205,57,"You, that's okay. Hey Nina. Hey Nina."
205,58,I'll help you this
205,59,Weekend since you something share. Tell us. Did this
205,60,Shut for?
205,61,Yes. What did you do this weekend?
205,62,I worked on my science fair project.
205,63,"You did awesome. Will, what did you do this weekend?"
205,64,"LL Collection. Oh, very cool. And I'm classifying on board and, um, about all the effects of the"
205,65,"I'm very excited to see that when you bring it in. That will be very cool. Thanks. Will, what did you do this weekend?"
205,66,I watched a game with my
205,67,Dad. What kind of game was it?
205,68,Basketball.
205,69,"Very cool. And, and simulation."
206,0,Begin simulation.
206,1,"Hey. Hello, my name is Mr. Swing."
206,2,Hi
206,3,There. How are you?
206,4,"Good. Good,"
206,5,"Good. How are you doing? Good, thank you. Uh, so today we're gonna go over some classroom norms that are gonna help you, uh, stay focused this year and learn to the best of your abilities. Uh, can anyone volunteer something that, uh, might help you? Uh, stay focused this year? Yes,"
206,6,"Always, uh, paying attention."
206,7,"Always paying attention. Okay. So if I'm talking, uh, what is that? How can you model that? You're paying attention to me. How can you show me that you're paying attention?"
206,8,"Well, there's better ways to pay attention. So I think that like, maybe your answer should have been something else. Um, well, let's, let's pay attention."
206,9,"Okay. But first I think a good norm in this case would be listening to each other's opinions and respecting each other's opinions. Right. And then offering your own, what, what would your advice be as far as the norm?"
206,10,"Um, I would say like, showing up on time."
206,11,"Showing up. Oh, that's good. So punctuality. Excellent. So we have punctuality, we have listening. Oh, yes. Sorry, go ahead. Sorry, go ahead, Emily."
206,12,"No, I just got a, I got a text."
206,13,"Ah, okay. So I think another norm might be to keep technology at our side, so not use technology when we don't need it. Right. Gotcha. Okay. So cell phones can be great for using, for doing research in class, but they can be really distracting at times as well. Yeah,"
206,14,"Yeah. Oh, what about, um, I don't know, uh, like extracurricular stuff, like, uh, um, so I'm like really into science. Okay. So like, if I like, wanted to have, like, if we do like a, we like breakout time where we like talk about, um, maybe like what we're interested in, like how, like chemistry specifically."
206,15,"Okay. Well, I can make sure that when we have our lessons, that we have time to talk amongst each other, but I think what you're talking about more is more of an interest, not really a norm. Alright. So, uh, what about, um, uh, yes. What?"
206,16,"Oh, no, I was just, will was yelling at"
206,17,Me. I wasn't yelling at you.
206,18,"It was just the scene. You should, so I think another norm would be to keep our conversations to a minimum, right. When I'm speaking. So your eyes should be up here, your eyes should be up here, right? Yes. Okay. So we have technology, we have listening to each other. What about, uh, respecting each other, respecting each other's opinions? I like that. Yeah. What would that include? How would you show that you're respecting someone's opinion?"
206,19,"Yeah, I think, uh, hearing them out, even if you don't like,"
206,20,Totally agree.
206,21,"Yeah, exactly. You"
206,22,"Know, listen and"
206,23,Right. So you really consciously listen to what they're saying. Right. You don't jump right away and say what you think. Right.
206,24,"Okay. Yeah. No,"
206,25,Totally. Excellent. Good job.
206,26,Hundred percent.
206,27,Okay.
206,28,"Oh, we're having a, a science fair is gonna be happening I think like around Halloween,"
206,29,"So, okay. Yeah. I don't know. Oh, excellent. Thank you for letting us know that that's not exactly what we're talking about right now. We're talking about our norms that we're coming up with together. Gotcha. Yeah. So let's stick to that topic. Okay. Okay. So that could be another norm. So let's stay on task with what we're focusing on, on at the moment. So if we're doing math, we're doing math, we're not talking about music or whatever, right? Yes."
206,30,"I just think, uh, another thing that would help us, like pay attention is it, if no one said this already mm-hmm. <affirmative>, like no cell phones and, and, and"
206,31,Like Right. We mentioned
206,32,Social media.
206,33,"Social media. Okay. So that's more specific than what we mentioned. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So just using our cell phones for academic"
206,34,Purposes. Is this boring? Why are we doing it? I don't know why we're doing
206,35,"Well, it may seem boring now, but it'll help you later in the year, trust me, because it'll, it'll make sure that we're all learning together. We're not distracted yet. Excellent."
206,36,I
206,37,"Hear that. All right. Anyone else have any other things to offer? Um, what about raising your hand? What about raising your hand? Oh, yeah. Actually,"
206,38,"Like, always make a good effort. Is that too generic?"
206,39,"Yeah. No, that's good. I think that's something to keep in mind. It's generic. Think of a better, wait a second. Wait a second. Remember we said that our remember our norm about listening to each other? Exactly. What? And not jumping right on what people say. I'm sorry. All right. Let's respect each other's opinions. Sorry. Thank you. Sorry. Okay."
206,40,Sorry Mr.
206,41,"Sw. That's all right. Alright. All right. So all those norms, I'm gonna adhere to them too because that's important, right? That I also follow these norms. Yep. Right. All right. Excellent. Well, thank you for talking to me about this. I'm glad that we, uh, had this discussion. I think it'll be a productive year."
206,42,Cool. No problem. Bye.
207,0,And stop simulation.
207,1,"Good morning. Class. So today we're gonna go over the classroom expectations again because we, I think we need just a little reminder of those. So remember the first one we've talked about is compassion. Right? Everybody? What"
207,2,"I just did, right? Yes. Okay."
207,3,"Everyone is doing their best. Right? Every day everyone's doing their best and sometimes their best doesn't look the same as what you think their best should look like. Well, that doesn't mean that it's not their best. Yeah."
207,4,Don't interrupt when she's talking. Okay. Hi. Thank you guys. Okay.
207,5,"Um,"
207,6,"Go ahead,"
207,7,Nina.
207,8,Yes.
207,9,Thank you honey. I've got it. Okay.
207,10,Okay.
207,11,"Um, kindness. Remember we're being, we need to try to use our, uh, our most kind words to speak to each other. Yeah. That goes along with the other one."
207,12,Sorry.
207,13,"You okay, Emily?"
207,14,"Yeah. I'm sorry. Um, I'm getting texts from good people. Sorry."
207,15,"Okay. Uh, if you'd like to talk about that after class, we can do that. Okay. Oh no,"
207,16,It's alright. Just gimme a tag. Thanks. I leave you.
207,17,"Um, that goes a little bit into listening, right? We need to listen to whoever is speaking at the moment, if that's right."
207,18,"Oh, I wanted to ask, are we doing like a science fair this year? Um, cause I'm really into science fairs,"
207,19,"So. Yes. Carlos, you"
207,20,Talked science fan if you will. Mm-hmm.
207,21,"<affirmative>. Yeah, we've talked about that before, remember? Yeah. And we'll, we'll talk about that a little bit later too. I'll give you some more specifics. Okay."
207,22,"Cool. Great. Yeah, I'd love to hear about it. Cause that's my ideas, so"
207,23,"Great. I would love to hear them. Um, yes. Remember. So we're gonna listen completely to the person who's talking all the way through and, and, uh, lastly, we're here to learn, right? And if we're gonna learn, we have to do listening. Yeah. Okay, guys. Um, what did you guys, what was the best part of your weekend?"
207,24,"Um, I, uh, a museum. That's pretty cool. Oh yeah. I want to Busy natural history in New York."
207,25,Very cool.
207,26,"Dinosaurs. Such like,"
207,27,"Yes. That's awesome, Jayla. Thank you for sharing."
207,28,No problem. Love it.
207,29,What about you Emily?
207,30,"Um, I just started to watch TV and stuff."
207,31,Yeah. What do you like to watch?
207,32,"Um, like documentary about like, nature, animals. Very,"
207,33,Very cool.
207,34,"Oh, I love like, stuff about science and like science fairs. And have you thought anything about the science fair since we talked about it before?"
207,35,"Um, not in, uh, not since we last discussed it, but I promise we talk about it later. Okay,"
207,36,Cool. I have ideas.
207,37,Yes. I'm excited to hear them.
207,38,Cool.
207,39,"Uh, what about you? Mina?"
207,40,Ohk. Hi. Yeah. Bye. My dog.
207,41,Your dog?
207,42,Yeah.
207,43,Very cool. What's your dog's name?
207,44,"Um, scrappy."
207,45,Scrappy. Nice. What about you? Will?
207,46,"Um, uh, bees. I'm a big fan of bees, so, um, kind of boring. Why are we doing this?"
207,47,"I think it's nice to share about, um, each other's weekends to hear about each other's life because, you know, you all have a lot more that happens outside of school. Right. Gotcha. Your life isn't just school."
207,48,"Oh, that's a good thing. So Yes, good point. Definitely."
207,49,"Um, and so I think it also gives us a little bit of perspective to know what other people do at home. Uh, Carlos, I didn't hear what you do."
207,50,"Bees are dumb. What do you mean? Bees are dumb? Oh, Mina, these are dumb."
207,51,Mina? Yes.
207,52,"Sorry, sorry, sorry."
207,53,Does that go along with our expectations that we just talked about?
207,54,No. No.
207,55,Okay.
207,56,"Sometimes she just like likes to yell at me and stuff, so I get mad and like yell bad. So it's not a good relationship."
207,57,"Okay. Well it's understand,"
207,58,But here we are. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.
207,59,"Yeah. Well, it's understandable to, you know, to have the, like, to get upset when other people Yeah. Um, say things that you don't agree with, but"
207,60,Yeah.
207,61,"Um, it's, it's not, we probably shouldn't handle it by telling other people how they feel and act. Right. Okay. Yeah. We just talked about things, how it makes us feel."
207,62,Right?
207,63,Right. The I statements we've talked about
207,64,"And, and simulation."
208,0,And start simulation.
208,1,Hello class.
208,2,Hi there.
208,3,Today we're gonna talk about our classroom norms that we made at the beginning of the year and go back through just to review them. Okay? So do you guys remember our first norm that we came up with together was we said that we wanted to always come to class ready to learn. Can anyone tell me what that means?
208,4,"Um, be prepared."
208,5,Great. What would it look like to be prepared for class?
208,6,"Well, answering. I don't, I don't see"
208,7,Nina. It's okay if Will doesn't answer Nina. It's okay if Will doesn't know the answer.
208,8,Okay. I'm just trying to encourage him.
208,9,Thank you.
208,10,"Sure, sure. No"
208,11,"Problem. Does anybody else have an answer? For what? Like, to be prepared."
208,12,"Um, I think maybe it needs, uh, like, you know, having your homework done and like, being ready to contribute."
208,13,"That's a great example, Carlos. Thank you. All right. Our next norm that we came up with is we said that we wanted to always listen when someone else is talking. Why did we say this was an important norm?"
208,14,"I'm getting it. Text. Sorry. Um, paying attention keeps everything kinda moving."
208,15,"Great. Emily, do you remember? Yes. What our other norm was about using technology in the classroom?"
208,16,"Um, no, I'm sorry. I get these tweet notifications. All the impeachment stuff."
208,17,There's a lot going on in the news right now. Can somebody remind Emily what we
208,18,"Made? Oh. Oh, speaking of which I wanted to see. Um, so what's, uh, your policy on like, like, um, if I wanted to have like a, like a rocket club or something like that? Great."
208,19,You wanna have a rocket club in the classroom?
208,20,"Well, not, I mean, I guess I, I just was wondering how like, extracurriculars work and if we could like, use the room and stuff like"
208,21,"That. Great. That's a great question, Carlos. Can we talk about that once we finish reviewing our classroom norms?"
208,22,"Answer will, well should push me around."
208,23,"All right. Will and Mina. If somebody has an answer, they can choose to share. Okay. We don't have to tell each other what to share. Remember our next best talks about our next norm is we said that we wanted to respect our classmates. Do you guys remember what the word respect means?"
208,24,Yes.
208,25,What does it mean Jayla?
208,26,"Um, listening. Like when other people talk, um, you know, respecting opinions. No, not touching people's stuff. Just being respectful. Great."
208,27,"Come around. Great. Those are all great examples. So when we do that, we'll make everyone feel welcome and a part of our class, right? Yeah."
208,28,Yeah.
208,29,"All right. So we, we had one more norm that we came up with. So we remember we said, not that we were going to use materials the way they're supposed to be used."
208,30,"Oh. Oh, when is the science fair? Cause like, I learned how to make this like a volcano, uh, with was it bacon, soda and like, uh, other stuff. That sounds really cool. How idea is, is my point."
208,31,"Exactly. Those are great ideas and we'll get to them as soon as we finish going through our norms. Okay? Ok. Cause remember we just talked about wanting to listen to each other and respect each other. Okay. So once we finish, we'll talk about the science fair. All right, so our last norm, we talked about using the materials the way they should be used. Can anybody give an example of what that looks like? Will, do you have any ideas? Oh, Emily."
208,32,"Well, um, maybe I, I dunno. This is boring. Why are we doing this?"
208,33,"That's a great question, Jayla. Yeah. Why are our classroom norms important? Just curious. Do you remember?"
208,34,Mm-hmm.
208,35,"<affirmative>, why is it important for us to have norms?"
208,36,"Um, well, I guess like, so we're not all running around crazy."
208,37,"Great. Yeah, that's a great reason. So I like of"
208,38,A better.
208,39,Yeah. So our last one we talked about using materials the way it should be. An example. I can give you one. I know you
208,40,"Shouldn't tell me what to do anymore. Well, you should participate more,"
208,41,More Will andina.
208,42,"Well, yeah, sorry. Yeah, yeah. All right. Sorry. Just opening up some, some old wounds over here."
208,43,Let's talk about that in a few minutes. Okay?
208,44,Okay.
208,45,"All right. So when we wanna use our materials the way they should be, a good example of that, remember, is we can use our computers when we're doing math games, but when we're not doing math games, we don't wanna be on the computers. Right? Okay, great. All right. So that was all of our classroom norms. Cool. So we wanna remember that we keep following these so we can respect each other and have a good learning environment, kind of like Jayla was saying earlier. Um, and, and."
209,0,And start simulation.
209,1,"Hi guys. Can you hear me? Everything good? Awesome. Okay, so we're going to establish our classroom norms today."
209,2,Okay.
209,3,"First, are there any suggestions that you all can think of that you would like to talk about for having as our classroom norms?"
209,4,"Uh, let's see. Well answer. I don't have an answer."
209,5,"Okay. I can answer, I can give y'all some ideas that I have come up with and see how you think with it."
209,6,"Sound good? So, well I just, I don't have anything to say. Mina."
209,7,"Okay. Mina. I, me, I'm over here also. Okay. Thank you. So we can actually, a first norm that I was thinking of is when the teacher is talking, that you could technically look towards me. So I know that you're listening and then we can engage with each other."
209,8,Okay.
209,9,How does that sound?
209,10,Sounds good. Awesome.
209,11,Yep.
209,12,Okay.
209,13,"So another one next, another one I was thinking of is when we want to speak we can raise our hands."
209,14,Okay. Sounds good.
209,15,Awesome. Third? Yes. Jayla?
209,16,"I was thinking maybe like, no texting in"
209,17,"Class. Okay. That I agree with that one. I forget cell phones exist sometimes, um, for younger kids now. Oh. So,"
209,18,"Oh, whoa. I wanted to say, um, how do you feel about like, um, chemistry and like science and stuff? Hey"
209,19,Carlos. Oh
209,20,Yes.
209,21,"Um, how about we put that conversation off to a little bit later?"
209,22,Okay.
209,23,"And we can get through the classroom door. So I definitely wanna hear how chemistry sounds. All right. So, but did anybody else have any suggestions?"
209,24,"Why don't you talk, uh, you be quiet. Stop. Tell me what to do."
209,25,"Okay, so 1, 2, 3 eyes on me."
209,26,Okay. Sorry.
209,27,"Sounds great. Okay, so we have what two have we, can someone tell me the two we thought of right now?"
209,28,"I'm sorry, I didn't, what was that last?"
209,29,What norms have we decided so far? We have no texting in class. Yep. What's another one?
209,30,"Um, be respectful of like other people's opinions. Myself."
209,31,Okay. Good one. That's a good one. I like that one. Cool.
209,32,"Um, thank"
209,33,"You. And how can we show our respect to others? How, what are some things we can do so that people know that we're respecting their opinions?"
209,34,"Um, like, you know, respecting their opinion. Like if you don't agree with them, you know, hear 'em out and if you disagree, talk about it like civilly, you know, oh, are we gonna have a science fair this year? That's what I meant to ask before."
209,35,"Um, sh I actually don't know. I soon will be later in the semester."
209,36,I have ideas. I'm just saying.
209,37,Awesome. Do you have any class norm ideas?
209,38,What's that?
209,39,Do you have any ideas for the class norms?
209,40,"Yeah. Yeah. Uh, show up on time."
209,41,"That's a good one. I like that one. Um, cause that shows we have respect for each other and the class and make sure everything, yeah. Going smoothly. Um, what I thought of is to use kind words when we're speaking to our friends and our classmates because that's another way to show respect and we can act kindly towards them."
209,42,"This is boring. Why are we doing this? I'm sorry, I forgot"
209,43,We are doing this So we can have a productive school year and we can go on and have this set up now so we don't have to deal with it later.
209,44,Fair enough. Fair enough. Okay. Gotcha.
209,45,Okay.
209,46,Makes sense.
209,47,So last four I believe. Are there any more you can think of?
209,48,"Always be like, ready to work. That'd be good."
209,49,"Okay. And how can we, how what does that look like?"
209,50,What does it look like? Mina. Lemme tell her I'm trying to talk to her. Sarah mean like maybe Will has to learn how to be quiet cause he doesn't know. How does his mom teach him? Okay.
209,51,"Okay. Um, enough that's stop doesn't really follow her kind words Norm. Um, so how can we reword that?"
209,52,Okay.
209,53,To be not aggressive.
209,54,"Sorry. Um, so anyway, sorry I lost track."
209,55,"Um, it's okay. And"
209,56,Then I have a contentious relationship. I think it's alright. Cool.
209,57,Glad you're aware
209,58,Of it. And end simulation. Okay.
210,0,Good. Begin simulation.
210,1,Good afternoon class. How are we doing today?
210,2,"Good,"
210,3,"How are you? I'm fine, thank you. It's great to have all of you with me today. Uh, we are a couple weeks into the semester, but I thought it would be a good idea for us to review some of our classroom norms. Um, so I wanna get right into it. So I wanna remind you guys that one of our first classroom norms is to raise a quiet hand when you have a question or something to contribute. Um, why do you think we decided that that was a good classroom Norm to have"
210,4,"Answer? I don't wanna answer. I don't have an answer. Come on. You need to participate, mark, come"
210,5,"On. Well, you know, as I hear someone talking, um, while we're waiting for someone to raise a by hand, that will take me into one of our other classroom rooms, which is to be respectful of each other. And that would mean to not talk when someone else is talking or to just give someone a couple minutes to get their thoughts together before they decide to contribute."
210,6,Sorry.
210,7,"That's okay. Text. Oh yeah. Another one of our classrooms, like I just said, is about being respectful and one of the ways that we can be respectful to each other in our class, but, um, our teachers is by not using our phones in class, Emily. Okay."
210,8,Gotcha. But
210,9,"Anyway, yeah. Thank you so much. I appreciate that. Sorry. Oh, I'm so glad that you use your kind words cuz that is one of our, our other classroom norms is using kind words. And so,"
210,10,"Oh, I was, I wanted to ask you to cue, are we"
210,11,"Carlos, are we"
210,12,"Gonna have a, um, like a,"
210,13,"What, what was one of the first classroom norms that we talked about just now?"
210,14,"Oh, I'm sorry. You know, so I'm kinda a, like a, a science junkie."
210,15,"I I get that. Carlos, I would love to hear what you have to say, but I'd like for you to raise a quiet hand so we can demonstrate those classroom norms. Okay."
210,16,I'll stop.
210,17,I don't want you to stop. I would just like for you to raise a quiet hand and then I can call on you. Gotcha.
210,18,"Gotcha. Lena, where"
210,19,Do you go? Carlos? Carlos? What do you have to contribute?
210,20,"Uh, yeah, I was just saying, um, science. I love science."
210,21,"Oh, I do. I love science as well. Why do you love science so much, Carlos? Yes."
210,22,"Hey, stop telling me what to do. Okay. Can you look"
210,23,"Embarrassing? Will, yes. Can you remind me of one of the classroom norms that we just talked about?"
210,24,"Yes. Um, to be respectful"
210,25,And how can we show Carlos that we are being respectful of him right now?
210,26,"Uh, to, to not, um, interrupt."
210,27,"Wonderful. Thank you. So can we give Carlos the flow one more time so you can tell us why he loves science so much,"
210,28,"Much appreciate it. Um, no, so I was just thinking, um, I dunno if we're like, uh, gonna be doing a lot of science in here or what are you, what are your, what are your thoughts?"
210,29,"We will definitely be addressing some science in this classroom, but for right now, and I just wanted to make sure that everybody was on the same page, just so I thought we should Gotcha. Take a couple minutes to talk about our classroom."
210,30,"What about, uh, like science fairs? Like would you be that as like an idea going forward?"
210,31,That would be wonderful. Carlos. Does anyone else have any contributions that they wanna make to this?
210,32,"Uh, yeah. Um, oh, well, sorry."
210,33,"Yes, Julia?"
210,34,"Yeah. Um, I was thinking maybe like texting is not the best idea. Like, is it"
210,35,Norm? I like that. That's wonderful. Why do you think texting would not be a good idea in class?
210,36,"Um, it could be like pretty disruptive actually."
210,37,"That is, and so that ties into our respect for one another, right? Right. We wanna make sure that when someone is talking, we're giving them undivided attention and"
210,38,"We're, this is, um, this is boring. Why are we doing this? Do you think"
210,39,"We're doing this so that we can proceed in a orderly fashion, offer our classes and just to make sure that we're all on the same page going forward."
210,40,Okay. Gotcha.
210,41,"Yeah. Anybody else? All right, great. So now that we're all in a group, I'm sorry Hannah, did you have something you wanted to contribute? Oh, no, not at all. Okay, wonderful. Now that we're all on the same page in terms of our class norms, we can proceed to our next lesson. Okay."
210,42,"Pay attention. Will what? Sorry. It's just,"
210,43,"Does anyone wanna tell me, uh, about something fun that they learned in their previous class?"
210,44,"Uh, well, not making fun of me. Gosh."
210,45,"Will, is there something that you'd like to contribute or is there someone that's not being respectful of you"
210,46,"Right now? Oh no, just Nina and I sniping at each other,"
210,47,So yeah. Is that being respectful or are you guys using kind words?
210,48,"Um, we're we got issues?"
210,49,"Oh, I'm sorry. Did you guys, is there something that I can help you guys with?"
210,50,"No, no. We should just behave. I agree"
210,51,"That is true, but is there something that I can help you guys talk through?"
210,52,"No, no, no. I think we, we agree with that, right? Okay. Should just stop"
210,53,Emily Efford. Okay. And simulation.
211,0,Begin simulation.
211,1,Hi everyone. I'm Miss H. It's so nice to see you. Hi there. Hi. So today we are going to be creating some norms for our classroom. Can anyone raise their hand and tell me what a norm is?
211,2,Huh?
211,3,Yeah. Yeah. Jayla.
211,4,"Oh, it's sort a like a rule that everybody kind of agrees to follow."
211,5,"Yes, exactly. A norm is a rule that everyone agrees to follow. So when we set norms for our class, that means that these are the expectations we're going to have for everybody. So could"
211,6,"You pick up my mental,"
211,7,"I'm also going to set some norms just for this discussion so that we can be productive and we can help each other out. So Will and Anna, can I get your eyes facing forward please? Sorry."
211,8,Sorry.
211,9,"It's okay. Thank you for facing forward. Um, so for this discussion, if you have an idea for a norm, I want you to raise your hand like this. Um, when other people are talking, you are not talking. We're listening to what our classmates are saying."
211,10,Okay.
211,11,So does anyone have any ideas for some norms we want for our class?
211,12,Text?
211,13,Yeah. Carlos?
211,14,"Uh, yeah. Um, I was thinking like maybe respect other people's opinions."
211,15,Yeah. Respect other people's opinions. And how would that look in our class?
211,16,"Uh, well, you know, if somebody says something you don't agree with, uh, you hear around, oh, I also wanted to ask you about science. Do you like science? Cause I was thinking like, I have this really cool project that I came up with, uh, make a Volcano and I didn't know if I could like show it class next time I come in. Carlos,"
211,17,"I love, I love how enthusiastic you are about your volcano, but right now we're setting norms after this, maybe we can talk after class."
211,18,"Okay, that sounds good."
211,19,"So just to recap, Carlos's Norm was to respect others' opinions. Does anyone else have another norm that they would like to share?"
211,20,"Yeah, it should. Bem shouldn't be able to tell me what to do. Well, if you knew what to do, I wouldn't have to tell you when I Oh, you're so mean."
211,21,"Will and Mina, we are going to talk after class. Okay. Um, but will I also want for this norm setting discussion to be something that's respectful. Okay. And so when we're setting the norms, it needs to be something for our whole class and it does not need to be targeted at anyone in class. Okay. Okay. Does that sound good?"
211,22,"Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I was gonna think of a think of something actually. Okay. I was thinking like, showing up on time is important."
211,23,Yeah. That's a very good norm. Showing up on time. Yeah. Cool. And why is it important that we show up on time to class?
211,24,"Well, if we do that, then like we all be on the same page. You all kind of learn"
211,25,"Together. Yeah, exactly. I love that. So we're gonna be on the same page. Everyone's going to be organized. Perfect. That"
211,26,"Was, oh, we should totally have a, a science fair this year. That's a great idea."
211,27,"Carlos. Sorry. A science fair is a wonderful idea for a final project Maybe, but since norms are something that we're going to hold each other accountable for in the class. Okay. That just wanna as a norm. But I will keep that in my mind. Thank you."
211,28,"Okay,"
211,29,Welcome. What about other norms for our class? Can I get one more? One more volunteer? Yeah. Mina.
211,30,"Hi. Yeah. Maybe, um, no social media or like texting, taking pictures. Has someone said that"
211,31,"Or no? No one said that. I think that that's a very good point. So why is it important? So are you saying that we should not be on our phones during class? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why is it"
211,32,"Important? Why are we, um, this is boring. Why are we doing this? It's me, Jayla."
211,33,"Well, Jayla, I think that we're doing this well. I know that we're doing this because we want our class to be organized. We want it to be productive and we wanna be able to have fun in this class. So these norms are really important for all of us to be able to get along and help each other out while we're in class. Um, okay. I'm gonna go back to Mina. Mina. Your norm I think is wonderful. Why is it important that we don't have phones in class?"
211,34,"Well, will, over here. Let's text. Don't you will. Oh, I don't, yeah, you did. No, I don't."
211,35,Mina will can I get attention back on me? Eyes on your case?
211,36,Sorry.
211,37,"So like you talked about before, when we're setting norms, this is a place where we're going to respect each other. We're not going to target each other. So that means only having positive things to say about our classmates. Yeah. Alright. We do that. So right now we have three norms. Carlos said that we should respect each other's opinions, will had the great contribution that we should all be on time. Mm-hmm. And Mina said that we should not have phones in class. So we're not texting not on social media. We are present."
212,0,And
212,1,Start simulation.
212,2,"Hi everyone. So today we're gonna go over our three classroom norms. So our first one is being a good listener. Can anyone raise their hand and tell me what it means to be a good listener? Yeah, Emily."
212,3,"Um, it means like not talking when other people are talking and waiting your turn."
212,4,"Very good. Yeah, it does. It means waiting our turn when other people are talking just like I did to Emily. Emily was talking and I waited until she finished to say what I needed to say. Does anyone else, can anyone else think of things that would make us feel business"
212,5,"Topic? You for your, your science."
212,6,Anna?
212,7,I don't need any help. Emily. Business.
212,8,"Huh? Now guys, what we just saw there was not being a very good listener. So see I was talking and I was asking"
212,9,Question.
212,10,"Thats to the second rule of being good listener. So a second rule being a good listener is maintaining eye contact with a speaker. So we can't maintain eye contact if we are looking at our phones. That's why we need to put away our phones and look up and maintain eye contact. Okay, let's move on to our second rule classroom norm. Our second one is to use our manners. That means we"
212,11,"Should say, oh, I can, um, I can take all the notes for the, um, classroom norms. I was described last year in my, um, class. So I can get my pen out. Take the notes if you want me to. Teacher. You want me to write everything"
212,12,"That, that's great. Carlos, you can take notes, but remember what? I just being good. So I'm speaking right now. So we're gonna all listen to me until I ask a question and then you wanna answer the question. You raise your hand. Okay. Awesome. So to use our manners, that means that we have to say please and thank you. When people"
212,13,Shut. What bothering me. You're getting me in trouble.
212,14,"Okay, shut means"
212,15,Shut up. Nina. Shut up. I don't wanna hear it. Leave me alone.
212,16,"Um, <laugh>. So we're using our manners. So that means that not only would we need to say please and thank you, we also need to be nice to our peers and our classmates. So that means we need to use nice words like, could you please not talk to me at this moment instead of other mean words that might make us seem like we're mad at them. Okay? So then let's go on to our third classroom norm. So that's being respectful to our environment. So being respectful to our environment means that we, we respect our classroom and we wanna keep it clean. So how can we keep our classroom clean? Can someone raise their hand and tell me,"
212,17,"Um, are we gonna talk about the science fair? Cause I have my topic ready? Carlos,"
212,18,"Remember we raise our hands. Questions? Sure. You approve? Okay. So did we have any suggestions for how we can respect our classroom? Anyone? Well, here I have a suggestion. Um, if we drop"
212,19,"I do, I do."
212,20,"Oh, will yeah, go ahead."
212,21,"Um, keep everything clean on our desks. Like, um, like clean up after you're finished with your work."
212,22,"Very good. Yeah, that means keeping our desk clean and clear because if we have a really clutter desk, it can be hard to do work. What if we see a piece of trash on the floor and it's not our trash? We didn't put it there. What do we do?"
212,23,"Oh, why are we doing this? This is boring."
212,24,"Okay, so yeah, Jayla, I understand that you think this is a little boring and I know it can get tedious, but we have to go over these rules so that way we have a good classroom environment. So if I see a piece of trash on the floor, even if I didn't make that trash, I'm not gonna make a class. And it's not mine. I'm not picking"
212,25,Is you we're coming this weekend. I already have a topic.
212,26,"So Mina, this is our classroom, right? So Mina, if you see trash on the porch, what would you do?"
212,27,Nina? Be quiet. You're distracting me and I don't like it.
212,28,"And see, that was, I'm very glad example of using our manners. So instead of saying mean words to Mina, when she distracted him, he kindly told her that she was distracting him and he wanted her to stop. So that was a very good job. Will I thank you for that. So if we see trash on the floor, even if it's not ours, we pick it up and we keep it clean. And those are our three classroom, uh, norms. Okay, so who wants to tell me about what they did this weekend?"
212,29,An end.
213,0,Begin simulation.
213,1,"Good afternoon, class. I'm Mr. Cohan. Could we starting with Carlos, uh, introduce ourselves to the class and say our names?"
213,2,"Uh, hey, I'm Carlos. Hello."
213,3,"Hi, Carlos."
213,4,"Um, I am Emily."
213,5,"Hi. Hi, Emily."
213,6,"Hello, I'm Jayla."
213,7,"Hi, Jayla."
213,8,"Um, I'm"
213,9,"Will. Hi, will"
213,10,Mina. Hi.
213,11,"Hi, Mina. Welcome. Welcome to class. It's great to see all of you"
213,12,Will.
213,13,So you
213,14,Need to speak up. You're like way too quiet. Hey
213,15,"Mina, can you hear me?"
213,16,"Yes. Oh yeah, I can, I can. So"
213,17,"We're gonna talk about some class expectations. Um, what's an expectation?"
213,18,Sit up straight.
213,19,"Mina straight. Well sit up straight. That's an example. Okay. Yeah. But we don't need to, we don't need to suggest things to our classmates. Okay. Our first rule and expectation in this class is to respect others. Okay. So by respecting others, we don't necessarily need to correct them. We can let the teacher do that. When someone's talking, we put our eyes on them. Okay. Eye contact and refrain. Not talking to others while the teacher is talking. While other, while others are talking. Okay."
213,20,I keep texting. Sorry
213,21,Emily. I'm so glad you're doing that because our second expectation in this class is no phones. Our phones have to be away.
213,22,That's
213,23,"Awesome. Yeah. So, Emily,"
213,24,"Can you like about, um, what's"
213,25,"It, one second. Carlos, Emily, I need you to put your phone away. Okay?"
213,26,Okay. I can doing it. Turn
213,27,"It off. Okay. Thank you. We're gonna turn our phones off when we come to class and we're gonna put them away. Yeah. Okay. Um, there might be different expectations in other classes, but in this class we're not gonna use our phones. Okay, Carlos? Cool."
213,28,"So can, so I was thinking like we can have like a, like a science competition or something. I dunno if you're interested in that"
213,29,"At all, but, um, this is a social studies classroom, so don't tell me to sit up. Maybe you can, uh, talk to your science teacher now. Will Mina Sorry. Our third expectation in this class and I need eyes on me. Mina."
213,30,Okay.
213,31,"I need eyes on me. Okay. When I'm speaking is when we have something to share. We want to hear others' voices, but we need to raise our hands. Okay? Okay. So if you have something you'd like to share with the class to tell the teacher, why don't we raise our hands? Okay. And then when the teacher calls on you, you can share what you have to say with the class. Are there any questions about these expectations?"
213,32,Makes sense?
213,33,"Okay. Makes sense? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Uh, Mina, you were shaking your head."
213,34,"Oh, no, no, no."
213,35,"You got it. Okay. Well, what did, uh, let's practice raising our hands and listening to others. Okay. What did, I'd like someone to tell me what they did this weekend."
213,36,"Uh,"
213,37,Carlos.
213,38,"Yeah. So, uh, basically I just sort of brainstormed about, uh, the science fair and, uh, came up with like a bunch of really cool ideas and I was thinking like we could all do like a, like a volcano competition. Um, as like a saying. I dunno. I just try to insert fun things."
213,39,That's interesting and I love your creativity and really cool. The passion that you have for science Yeah.
213,40,Is awesome. Volcanoes.
213,41,"Awesome. Carlos has anyone else, anything they did this weekend that they'd like to share?"
213,42,"Mina, it's, yeah, I went out, had some, uh, cress"
213,43,Grapes. Awesome. Has anyone else had crepes before?
213,44,Oh yeah.
213,45,Will. Did you like
213,46,It? Why are we doing it?
213,47,"We, well we are talking about our weekends to get to know each other a little better. Jayla, what did you do over the weekend if you'd like to share"
213,48,"It? Oh, uh, I read a lot. Uh, you know, I played some wiffle wall, uh, went to the boobies. It was"
213,49,"Pretty fun. That sounds, that sounds like an awesome weekend."
213,50,Oh yeah. I can't complain for
213,51,"Sure. That's fantastic. Emily, how about you?"
213,52,"Um, I, uh, I hung my dog cat. Let's be cool."
213,53,Very cool.
213,54,"Uh, do you do"
213,55,"Will, do you have something to share with the class?"
213,56,"Oh, no. I was gonna, I was just kinda mad at and I was just gonna tell her."
213,57,That's okay. Let's talk about that later. Let's review our expectations really quick. Who can tell me our first expectation in this class?
213,58,"Uh, to, uh, be"
213,59,"Respectful. Be respectful, respect others. Okay. Very good, Carlos. And remember, let's raise our hands. Okay. Oh, oh. Which was another, which was another one of our expectations, which is Carlos raising your hand. Perfect. And does remember our third expectation?"
213,60,No
213,61,"Phones. No phones. Perfect. Ah, okay. So those are the three big ones."
213,62,Home simulation.
214,0,Begin simulation.
214,1,Good afternoon class. How are you today? Good.
214,2,"Good,"
214,3,"Good. All right, so I thought we'd go ahead and just jump into our conversation of our classroom expectations. So this is what I expect you guys to do, the moment you walk in through the door and the moment you meet. So, let's talk about why it's important to be respectful. Who can tell me what being respectful means to them?"
214,4,Well speak up [inaudible] Stop.
214,5,So I think
214,6,"I ask a question,"
214,7,Rena. I think a good way to start this conversation is actually talk about why we raise our hands. So does anyone know why we raise our hands in a class? Cause I know we don't raise our hands at home when we need to talk.
214,8,"Um, so we'll get order I think."
214,9,Right? So what would happen if you guys all started shouting out at once? Would that be very productive?
214,10,No. No. Whoa. Sorry. It's my mom. <laugh>.
214,11,"So let's put our phones away because school doesn't let us have our phones out. Your mom, sorry, who knows? You're at school so she shouldn't be texting you."
214,12,"She's, she's really too much with the tech texting. Mm-hmm."
214,13,"So let's talk about why we raise our hands. So like you said, it would be chaos if we all shouted out. Do we kind of agree with that? Even though we don't raise our hands at home in a classroom, we have to raise our"
214,14,"Hands. Yeah, it would be chaotic also, I was thinking like maybe we could um, have like a, a messaging system or something like that. Um, I was also actually thinking about the science fair early on and I don't know if you had any ideas about that but over the holidays I was making, um,"
214,15,"Well Carlos, we'll talk about the science fair when it gets closer, but right now we need to focus on our expectations cause we still have a lot."
214,16,"We're too far away, that's"
214,17,For sure. Yep. We'll get there. But so one of the things about being respectful is your hands
214,18,"Will, you're so passing. Oh, sorry. Will."
214,19,"And your attention on me. So one of the things we talked about is raising our hands that's respectful of each other. How can we be respectful when we're talking to each other, to me to another teacher? Jayla, do you have an idea?"
214,20,"Like raise our hand and also like, um, you know, hear people out when they have something to"
214,21,"Say, right? So we're listening to people. We're not interrupting. Are we gonna say judgy things? Are we gonna be mean? We're not gonna be mean, right? Yeah. We're just gonna use nice words when we talk to people. So saying please and thank you are a, a good way to do that. That's definitely respectful."
214,22,"Yeah,"
214,23,I agree with that. And then the last thing I thought of when being respectful is our classroom and its materials. So I know you guys all come prepared with your own materials every day.
214,24,"Oh, so I made a paper machine dragon um, over the weekend and I was thinking like maybe, I don't"
214,25,"Know all Carlos. I would love to hear about that at recess or lunch meeting. Okay, right now we're gonna talk about what materials means in class. So I provide a lot of materials and you guys have a lot of materials. So what would happen if I just took all your pencils or something from home and just started breaking 'em? How would you feel?"
214,26,That'd be really weird. I wouldn't like
214,27,"It. It'd be weird. You wouldn't like it? Yeah. That's not very respectful of stuff. So I wouldn't expect you guys to come into my classroom and start doing that. Not just with pencils but showing on desks, anything like that. That's all a part of respecting your space. Cool. Seems like we have an understanding I wanted to talk about was there's idea this is"
214,28,Boring. Why are we doing this?
214,29,"I'm sorry. Because Jayla, it's great to have a good foundation because maybe you haven't been in school very long and that's true. It's very different at home versus at school. Yeah. So we need to make sure we're all on the same page."
214,30,I trust you.
214,31,I trust you. Thank you. I appreciate that. So another I wanna talk about was us being safe. Cause there's a lot of kids at this school and why is it important for us to be safe in the classroom or around the school In the hallway.
214,32,"I'll tell you something about Will, let's practice Will's a"
214,33,"Mina, let's practice Will all, will and Mina's a whole class conversation right now. Not a side to side. Okay,"
214,34,"We have some issues. Sorry,"
214,35,"I'll see if I can work out a solution with your seats. But for right now, let's talk about being safe. So why is it important for us to be safe in the hallway, for example?"
214,36,"Um, well I guess I can be close, but no. Yeah, it's uh, I don't know. Being aware of people,"
214,37,"Right? So when we're in the hallway there might be other classes going on. That's why I make you guys be quiet when you're in the line. Yeah, in the hallway. So that we don't interrupt other classes and we don't run, we walk, we use walking feed, right? So that no one runs into each other. Cuz sometimes those big classes, I agree. If I'm not looking where I'm going, I might run into something. So that's why it's important for us to always be looking forward and have walking."
215,0,Begin simulation.
215,1,"Okay guys, we're gonna talk about some of the behavioral expectations that we have in our classroom. Do you guys know what behavioral expectations are?"
215,2,"Um, so like, maybe just rules that we're all expect, expected to follow. Follow?"
215,3,"Yeah. Jayla, I think, um, we can think about them as rules, but, um, I feel like maybe rules are, it's more of a strict word, um, and feels a little bit more punitive."
215,4,It's an expectation.
215,5,"Yeah. We, we expect that you, um, come to school and behave in a certain way."
215,6,"Hey, Paul are shy. Come on dude. Nothing shy."
215,7,"Let's pay attention to what we're trying to talk about. So we're talking about what we expect from one another behavior wise at school. Um, I'm gonna go ahead and just tell you what I think is a good one. Um, and I'd love to hear your thoughts. Um,"
215,8,Sorry.
215,9,"That's okay. Let's pay attention. So, okay."
215,10,"I keep getting these so texts, sorry,"
215,11,"We're gonna put phones away. So the expectation is that we come to school ready to learn. Um, so that does include, you know, being ready to be engaged. We're not gonna have any distractions. Do you guys think that that's a good behavioral expectation?"
215,12,"Oh, I think it's a, it's a great expectation also. I was thinking like, if you would be cool if we could all like, um, you know, build our own like special, I was thinking like, it would be really cool if we had"
215,13,"Like, Carlos, is this related to what we're talking about right now?"
215,14,"Well, it would be like all of us participating in something. Um, and it would be like we all build like volcanoes and stuff."
215,15,"Okay, Carlos, that is a great idea for when we're doing a science project, but right now we're talking about expectations. So we're in school, we're ready to learn. Number two, and I think this is really important, is that we're gonna respect ourselves, others, and school property. Can you explain maybe why that would be an important expectation for us to have of ourselves? Emily, do you have any ideas? You"
215,16,Speak down.
215,17,"Hey, Mina. And will"
215,18,You speak up
215,19,Mina?
215,20,Yes.
215,21,"Sorry, I'm gonna need you to stop talking to Will. Okay."
215,22,"Okay, fine."
215,23,"So Emily, did you, do you understand why it's important to respect ourselves, others, and school property?"
215,24,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Absolutely.
215,25,"Yeah. So that's a great expectation. Uh, I'm gonna expect it of you guys and I think you guys should expect it of each other, um, and expect it of yourselves. So we're gonna just overall be super respectful, um, because that's what makes a good classroom environment. Um, and third of all is be safe. Um, can you tell me what being safe might look like?"
215,26,"Oh, the science fair's coming up. So that's Carlos."
215,27,We're not talking about science fair right now. I'm sorry. Can you talk to me about what being safe may look like?
215,28,"Um, well, maybe like, you know, don't run, don't throw things."
215,29,Don't run. Don't
215,30,"Throw things like a volcano. Don't, don't like,"
215,31,"Um, right. We're gonna just not talk about the volcanoes right now, but I appreciate your enthusiasm. Okay? So we're gonna be safe, um, with not, you know, trying not to get hurt. Um, and we can also be maybe"
215,32,"Like,"
215,33,Go
215,34,Ahead. Not taking other people's stuff. That'd be good.
215,35,Yeah. I think that maybe goes into respecting others and their properties. This
215,36,Is boring. Why are we doing this?
215,37,"Okay. So we don't need to be having those types of outbursts, but, um, yeah, for now, that's what I expect of you guys and I will be following up to make sure that we're all following these expectations. Um, do you guys wanna tell me what you did over the weekend?"
215,38,Hung out with my dog.
215,39,That sounds like a lot of fun.
215,40,Surprise. I built a volcano.
215,41,"I'm glad you did, Carlos. Nina,"
215,42,"What'd you do this weekend? Um, I made a darn board with your face."
215,43,Okay. Nina. Nina.
215,44,"Well, well"
215,45,"We can't talk to our friends that way. That's not kind language. And it's not respectful either. Well,"
215,46,Well be more respectful. You'd be more respectful. You'd
215,47,"Be more respect. Nina, I'm gonna have to talk to you afterwards. And Will, I'm, we're gonna talk as well. Okay. This is not respectful of each other."
215,48,Jayla issues. What
215,49,"Did you Sorry, will we don't speak to each other in that way. Jayla, can you tell me what you did over the weekend?"
215,50,"Uh, well, uh, actually had a really nice weekend. I went to a museum, uh, saw some dinosaurs. It was pretty cool."
215,51,Nice. So you learned a lot.
215,52,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. That's pretty
215,53,"Cool. That's great. And simulation. Uh,"
216,0,Are you ready? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. And start simulation.
216,1,Good morning boys and girls.
216,2,"Hey,"
216,3,"Today I wanted to talk to you all about um, something called behavioral expectations. Does anyone know what behavioral expectations mean? I mean, by that you can go,"
216,4,"You mean like, um, raising our hands and stuff like that? Teacher?"
216,5,"Yeah, Emily, that's a great expectation that we could have in our classrooms. So behavioral expectations are things as the teacher that they're sort of like rules that as the teacher, I would expect for you all to be doing. Um, the first one, actually, Emily, excuse me. Sorry. I don't"
216,6,"Hey,"
216,7,Nina.
216,8,"Nina,"
216,9,"Please stop talking right now. So, okay. Our first behavioral expectation I wanted to talk to you all about is raising your hand for permission to speak. Emily kind of hit the note on that one. So we wanna, why might we wanna raise our hands to"
216,10,Speak text?
216,11,"Emily, please put your phone away."
216,12,Okay.
216,13,"Why might we wanna raise our hands when we, um, to speak in class? Anyone have any ideas?"
216,14,"Oh, I know how we raise our hands, teacher. Um, but um, I gotta, I can keep all the notes, um, about the norms that we're doing. Cause um, we did this last year in school. Do you want me to write down everything for you?"
216,15,"That would, that would be wonderful. Carlos. You can go ahead and do that. You can do that quietly. That would be wonderful. Actually."
216,16,"So was last year. Notes have to have to raise our hands cause um, not everybody gets to learn."
216,17,Exactly. So Carlos did a great job answering that. So we wanna raise our hands so everyone has a turn to speak and you can hear other people when they're trying to talk.
216,18,Will
216,19,"Did you have something to ask there? I can. Nina, please stop talking."
216,20,"No, she keeps bothering me. She keeps talking"
216,21,"To me. Nina, please stop talking and we wanna make sure everyone focuses so we're raising our hands, um, for permission to speak. So the second expectation that I have for you all this year is to come prepared to class. Does anyone have any ideas of what coming prepared looks like?"
216,22,"Uh, oh, I raised my"
216,23,"Hand. Perfect. Jayla, I love that you raised your hand."
216,24,"Uh, it means that you come with a planner and your homework and all the stuff to get started."
216,25,"Exactly. So you wanna be coming with your, are"
216,26,We gonna talk about the science fair today? Cause I wanted go you before. So project started. Can we see?
216,27,"So not right now. Carlos, we're gonna focus on this and if you wanna keep taking notes, that'd be great, but we're gonna do that quietly. Thank you so much though. So, but I love how prepared you are, um, in doing that. So, for instance, we wanna make sure that we have our notes when we're gonna be taking notes in class. We wanna make sure we have our notebook, we wanna make sure we have our pencil, bring our homework to class. So Jayla got a lot of those. That's fantastic. And the third expectation I'm gonna have for you all is that you treat others how you want to be treated."
216,28,Why are we doing this? This is so boring.
216,29,"So, Jayla, that's a great question. So we're, we wanna set behavioral expectations so that we know every day what we should and should not be doing. So the third one, treat others how you wanna be treated. How is a way that you think you would wanna be treated in class? What is something that,"
216,30,"Um, everybody kind to each other? Yes,"
216,31,That's a great one. Everyone should be kind to one another. Does anyone else have any ways that they wanna be treated
216,32,In class? Please shut off. I don't wanna talk
216,33,"To Hey, this"
216,34,"Anymore. Well, I"
216,35,Can help you
216,36,Be quiet.
216,37,"Nina. Please stop talking. So what is, what is the way you wanna be treated? Nina? What is something important to you?"
216,38,"Uh,"
216,39,Ice. I guess. Ice.
216,40,"Ice being nice. That's uhhuh, that's a really important one. We wanna treat our classmates kindly. Um, that's super important. Will, how about you? What is something important to you that your classmates and how your classmates treat"
216,41,You? Respect for my own business.
216,42,Respect for your own business and simulation.
217,0,And
217,1,"Start simulation. Hi class. I'm Ms. Day. We <laugh>. Hi. Um, we are gonna talk about setting classroom norms for a minute. We're gonna choose three that we can all agree on, that we should all follow together. Do you guys have any idea what classroom norms are?"
217,2,"Um, the rules?"
217,3,"Yeah, they're like the rules are the expectations that we have of each other and that we want everybody to follow. Equally happy"
217,4,"With you. A science project tonight. I don't need any help from you, Mina, so don't"
217,5,Come over. All right. Mina and will together for you. We can use this interruption to start with one of the norms that I think that maybe we could talk about having as having respect for each other and what that looks like. And one of those things can look like not talking while somebody else is sharing. So let's make that classroom norm. Number one is to respect one another. And by doing that or to show that we're gonna do that by not interrupting each other. Does somebody wanna volunteer a classroom Norm for number two?
217,6,My mom.
217,7,Okay. I have been a good idea for classroom number rule number two or norm number two. How about we leave the phones in our lockers outside of the classroom so that we have all of our attention on the teacher or what we're learning in class? How does that sound? I
217,8,"Keep the notes for the, um, the norms. I was describing my class last year. I could keep all the, um, stuff written down for teacher. Do you want me to go ahead and that I'll get my pencil out."
217,9,That sounds great. Carlos. You can record ours and then when you're done can poster for the class so everybody knows them.
217,10,Oh yeah. Okay.
217,11,"All right. Does anybody have something that they think that could be our third classroom norm? Okay,"
217,12,"Well I help you come over. Will you shut up and leave Nina your business? Well, I just wanted to"
217,13,"Help you. All right. Nina or Nina? And will I have an idea for norm number three? How about only using kind languages? Will, what's another way that you could rephrase your response to Nina so that it doesn't hurt her feelings? Um,"
217,14,"Like, no, thanks. I'm good, but I keep telling her that and she keeps bugging me. Well, I just wanna help him cause I usually do well on the science fair."
217,15,"Okay. Well, you know, that is something that will, will have to, to decide for himself. And if he says that he doesn't want your help, you have to respect that and you need to leave him alone. Sorry."
217,16,Sorry.
217,17,Will. That's okay. I appreciate the apology from both of you to each other.
217,18,"Are we gonna talk about the science fair? I wanted to go over my topic with you before recess cause I wanna get started tonight. So what I was thinking, I might do a seashell collection or something. How does that sound to"
217,19,"You? Carlos? We can revisit this later during science. So for right now, we're gonna continue okay. To talk about classrooms. Okay? So let's review our three norms. First one being respectful to one another and using kind words and by listening to each other. Second one? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Using what's, what's the second one? Carlos, you write down?"
217,20,"Um, um, using kind language"
217,21,"And, oh, that was the third one. The second one. Emily had to deal with something that you brought up. No cell phones. Leave them in the"
217,22,Classroom. What are we doing? This? This is boring.
217,23,"Well, good thing we just finished. So Jayla, you can share what you did this weekend."
217,24,"Um, I stayed home. I didn't go anything. Soccer game and stuff. Did"
217,25,Weekend. How did your soccer game go? Did you score goal?
217,26,"Okay. Andrew, please stop talking to me about this. The teacher already talked to you. Well, she's not listening right now, so talk about,"
217,27,"Well, I actually am listening."
217,28,Shut.
217,29,Will
217,30,"You, do you hear her? Do you hear her sh bugging"
217,31,"Me? I do hear her. Maybe. Well, we can solve this problem number one by moving you guys, you guys don't have to sit next to each other. Yes, but will I want you to apologize for using that mean language towards that we already discussed. We didn't wanna"
217,32,"Use I'm sorry, Nina. Sorry. It's ok. I know I can be in pain sometimes."
217,33,Okay.
217,34,End simulation.
218,0,"And stop simulation. Good morning class. Mr. Siegel here. I'm very excited. Hi. Hi. Hi. I'm very excited to be with you guys today we're gonna start off with the discussion about, uh, behavioral expectations. Behavioral expectations for our class are important so that we can create a fun and safe classroom environment. So, would anybody like to start us off today? What is one, uh, way that we can be respectful in the classroom? Anybody raise your hand or clap?"
218,1,"Okay. Um, if you don't stop talking to me, woo. I can help you with your uns project. I don't need"
218,2,"Mina. Hey, Mina. And Will right now. Mia and Will. Right now we are having a discussion as a group on our behavioral expectations. Do you guys have, uh, one way that we can be respectful in the classroom? You mean you will?"
218,3,"Um, like not having side conversations?"
218,4,"That's a great idea. Why would we not have side conversations? Why is it important to, to keep our eyes and ears on the teacher you speaking?"
218,5,"Text my mom. Um,"
218,6,"Emily, let's put our phones away for now. We'll keep going with, um, okay. Why is it important to have our eyes on the teacher?"
218,7,"Um, cause like nobody can hear the teacher and, um, it disrupts things."
218,8,That's a
218,9,"Great idea. I, for the, um, classroom norms, cause I, um, did it last year in my class. I can, um, get my pencil out. Just start, um, tv, track of it, T-shirt. Do you want me to,"
218,10,"Carlos, after we go through our three classroom expectations, I'll ask you to write them down afterwards. Is that okay?"
218,11,"Oh,"
218,12,"Thank you for help. So we'll had a great start keeping our eyes and ears on who is speaking. That way we can be respectful. Carlos, do you have another classroom expectation that we can, uh, have for our class today?"
218,13,I dunno. Okay. Did you hear what the teacher just said?
218,14,"Hey,"
218,15,You shut
218,16,"Up. Will, let's talk about, Hey. Thank you. Eyes and ears back on the teacher. Remember how we talked? This is a great example of our classroom expectation of having our eyes and ears on the teacher. So when someone is speaking, let's make sure we have our calm body, eyes and ears on the speaker. Okay? Thank you. Okay. All right. Emily, can you give us a classroom expectation how we can be respectful today in the classroom?"
218,17,I think you said
218,18,For sitting quietly. Yes. Keep going. Or Emily?
218,19,"Um, no cell phones."
218,20,Why should we not have our cell phones out during class?
218,21,"Oh, um, cause interrupt things. I always tell my mom I can't answer it, but sometimes she text me."
218,22,"Okay, so when no cell phones in the classroom, you can avoid"
218,23,"The science fair today. Um, I wanna Carlos, my topic by you. Thank"
218,24,"You much Sarah. Tonight. Carlos, we didn't talk about our, huh? We can talk about your project after our discussion. Keep thinking, keep thinking of our classroom norms because you're gonna be our scribe for when we over the three expectations are ready. Okay. I'm gonna have you so keep thinking, okay? Keep thinking of these ideas. I'm gonna have you write them down afterwards. All right. So we have, I"
218,25,Have one.
218,26,Yes. Would you like to contribute to a classroom expectation?
218,27,"Um, everybody's gotta raise their hand before they talk."
218,28,Okay. So that's a good idea. Why should we raise our hands before we speak?
218,29,Who's this boring? Why are we doing this?
218,30,"We are doing this so that we can have a safe and respectful classroom. Dayla. Carlos, keep going."
218,31,"Sorry. Um, well you gotta raise your hand because then everybody gets a turn to talk and we're not interrupting each other."
218,32,Okay? So let's review R three classroom expectations we've gone over today. Carlos had we had Wait our time.
218,33,I'm not gonna talk to anymore.
218,34,"Do you have a, do you have something? You"
218,35,Shut up.
218,36,Thank you. Come back here. Is is there something you wanted to share with the classroom today?
218,37,"Well, I mean, I was just telling, well, with this science project after school today"
218,38,Okay.
218,39,"Meet,"
218,40,"So right now, right now it's refocused back to our classroom expectations. We can Nina and well, we can talk to, you guys can talk about this after our discussion. I've loved the ideas that you've provided during our discussion today. Okay. So let's talk about the science project after. So let's review the three ideas that we've gone over. Thank you Mina. We have Carlos who said let's, let's raise our hand or wait our turn to speak. We had from Mina and will an off call out and end simulation."
219,0,And stop simulation.
219,1,"Hello class. So today we're going to, hello. So today we're going to review three classroom, um, expectations that we set for group meeting. Um, so the first one is raise your hand to be called on to answer. Ask a question. Can someone show us what this looks like?"
219,2,"Oh, I can. Okay. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>."
219,3,Okay. Carlos?
219,4,Yes. Raising your hand.
219,5,"Perfect. And so when we're raising our hand, um, should you be calling out as you're raising your hand or should you be quiet?"
219,6,I don't wanna talk about it. Just leave me alone. Ok. I wanna help you with entire project this year. Will you had problems last
219,7,Year? Hello Willie.
219,8,Quiet Nina.
219,9,So this brings us to our next expectation and speak one at a time and not over someone. So this time I was talking and then you two were talking on the side. So it's hard to hear the instructions that I'm giving.
219,10,Mm-hmm.
219,11,"<affirmative>? Yes. So our next one, um, our next expectation was speak one that time not over someone. So if you had some"
219,12,I got a text.
219,13,Emily?
219,14,Yes.
219,15,"Yes. Sorry. Yes. Thank you. So I was talking so if you needed to ask a question or you had something to share, what should you have done?"
219,16,"Um, well, was my mom texting me? So I just answered, but I have tell her not to. Yeah. You shouldn't be texting in class. And, um, anyway, do you want me to write down the, uh, the rules for doing teacher? Cause I'm, I'm usually in class and I can, um, write everything down."
219,17,"Yes, that's fine if write those down. So if you have question something to answer, um, or you wanted share opinion. Remember our first rule was, first expectation was to raise your hand. Yes."
219,18,"If you don't stop talking to me about this, I'm gonna tell the principal, just shut up."
219,19,"What were we were saying about not talking over someone? It's not being respectful, which is one of our classroom rules. If you're talking and I can't share what I'm saying. Thank you. So if you have anything else you'd like to share, please let me know and we can talk about it afterwards. Okay. Thank you. Okay, so then the third one is to be polite to one another. What are some examples of ways that we can be polite to one another? Jayla?"
219,20,"Um, just fine. Like not interrupting people when they're talking and to not have conversations."
219,21,"I like that one. And I liked how you raised your hand, Jayla. That was our first expectation."
219,22,"Can we talk about my science fair project today? I wanted my topic with you before I start tonight. I have some ideas about it. Um, can we, um, together and talk about that,"
219,23,"Carlos? I would love to talk about that after we finish reviewing our expectations. But remember what I said, if you have a question or you have something you wanna share, remember to raise your hand. Okay?"
219,24,"Oh, right. Okay."
219,25,Thank you. So we're gonna review our three expectations one more time. Can someone remind me what the first one is?
219,26,Hi Ken.
219,27,"Remember what we said we were gonna do? Yes. Carlos,"
219,28,Raise your hand.
219,29,Yes. Okay. What's our second one?
219,30,Why are we doing this? This is so boring.
219,31,"I know. May find it boring, but this is something important that we have to do so that we can make sure that we're all able to learn and be respectful of one another while we're meeting. So the second one was to one at a time and not over someone. So can someone show me how you would want to, um, share that idea with me? Yes. Jayla?"
219,32,Can I talk
219,33,Now? Yes.
219,34,Okay. Like
219,35,"That. Perfect. That was a great example. And then what's our last one? Will and Nina, remember what we said about not having side conversations? Nina?"
219,36,"Well, me, I'm not trying to talk to"
219,37,Her. I know. I just wanna
219,38,Help him with his Science Fair Project and make arrangements
219,39,"School. Yes, Nina. But remember what we said, we would do this after we are having a conversation. When you're talking to Will. While I'm talking, he can't hear the instructions that I'm giving. So then he can't be the best learner that he can be. So we can talk about it after this. Okay? Okay. Thank you."
220,0,Sure
220,1,Begin simulation.
220,2,"Good morning class. Hi. Hello <laugh>. Um, I miss Sophie, and today we're going to be discussing our behavioral expectations for this semester. So before we start this conversation, I'm just gonna set some ground rules of how this is gonna go. So this is an open conversation and I'm really excited to hear about what you guys are wanting to have our classroom look like. But as a reminder, when someone else is talking, we have open ears. And so in order to be the most successful in the classroom, how do we as a class need to behave? Does someone have some"
220,3,"Original, we talked about you participating more, not gonna listen to you"
220,4,"If we have something to say. I think one way that you can tell me that you have something to say is by raising,"
220,5,"I'm just urging. Well, to participate."
220,6,"Does anyone wanna raise their hands and say something that they're looking about? Um, what you need to be successful to me."
220,7,I'm sorry.
220,8,Anyone.
220,9,"I keep getting text from my, my mom. Sorry."
220,10,"So when we're having this discussion, we talked about having open ears and quiet mouth and a lot about that is so that we can respect one another and we are respectful by each other by having and quiet mouth"
220,11,"Gonna ask, um, are we gonna, um, like do like, um, science experiment this year? You think so? Like I was, cause I, I put together like some fake volcanoes over the holidays. It's gotta inspire."
220,12,"So Carlos, thank you so much for sharing that. But right now, volcano actually gonna be doing about what our expectation of the class. Cause I think sometimes it's hard to realize what we, what we want without talking about it. So then we're all on the same page. So does anyone have an idea how we want to,"
220,13,"You need act. You need to be told what to do. People are passing, you're passing passive."
220,14,"Nina And Will. It sounds like you guys are having a private conversation which isn't really following the original ground rules that I've placed in the beginning about having open ears and quiet mouths. So if you wanna have that conversation, oh,"
220,15,We can have one later. So that's what
220,16,"I need to ask. Wait, Carlos, I'm sorry I'm speaking. Oh, thank you. Okay, thank you. Sure. Okay, so if you wanna have that conversation later, you can definitely have it with me. But right now we're working on behavioral expectations, so I would really love to hear from you what you guys, some brown rules you wanna have in the classroom. Jayla or Emily, I haven't really heard you guys speak so much today, but do you have any expectations you've been thinking"
220,17,"Of? Um, I think like, uh, no cell phones. No cell."
220,18,That's a good idea. Okay. Why?
220,19,"Um, it could be super disruptive."
220,20,"Mm, okay. Okay. Definitely. So I'm gonna write that down. So no cell phones from Jayla"
220,21,Science Fair? That's what I was thinking. Okay. Do you think we could do like a science fair typing machine? What do you thinking? So
220,22,"How does that relate to our, our behavioral expectations for being in the classroom? So I like"
220,23,"That idea. I dunno, I was thinking like, um, things that would get us excited, which is sort of a form of behavior."
220,24,"Yeah. So I love that idea of excitement. So I think there's a lot of different ways to incorporate excitement into the classroom. And so I, but having like that, you know, being excited to walk into the classroom is definitely a good way. And we can talk about later how we're gonna incorporate excitement. Does anyone else, Emily, will or Mina any behavioral expectations we know we need to have in our classroom?"
220,25,"Um, well, hmm, I mean this is boring. Why are we doing this? I'm sorry."
220,26,"No, that's a fair question, Jayla. So we're doing this so that we can have some ground rules and expectations in order so that we can be the most successful students that we can meet. And in order to be successful, we need to know how we're supposed to behave and some, um, like what expectations we have for ourselves and for our friends. Um, so that does fair enough question, Jayla."
220,27,That's all good. Cool.
220,28,"Thank you. So any other, so right now we have some behavioral expectations is to bring excitement and passion into the classroom. Another one is, um, quiet cell phones. Well, so Nina, will, I already mentioned earlier that I'm expecting quiet open ears. You have, you have a specific behavioral bothering"
220,29,You need. He's threatening me so I I'm not threatening me. You're being bossed.
220,30,"You know, will, if you need to separate yourselves and you can't sit next to each other, that's fair. We're right now working on behavioral expectations and part of that, as I've mentioned prior, previously, you need open ears and quiet. So if you can't sit with each other right now, we can, you know, you can move and we'll work on this conversation later. But right now, you know, you're taking a time, um, away. Yeah, <laugh>."
221,0,Begin Nek.
221,1,"Am I just, hi. Hi guys. So welcome back to the class. How are you all doing today?"
221,2,I'm good.
221,3,"Good. Okay. So we here, I'm good. So we have Nina, will, Jayla, Emily, and Carlos. Okay. Yeah. So I'm Ms. As now, we're just gonna go over some of the class norms and some behavioral expectations before we dive into curriculum."
221,4,Sure. Off?
221,5,"Okay. Yeah, that's a good one. Thank you, bill. Yeah, so, hey,"
221,6,"Will, he has his,"
221,7,"Oh yeah, so that can be definitely. Okay. So we know that we're not allowed to use cell phones in class during the school day. You guys are allowed them after school, so that should already not be a problem. So just remember that if you do have your cell phone in your book bag, have it on silent because vibrate is very distracting."
221,8,Sorry.
221,9,Yes.
221,10,Sorry.
221,11,Yes.
221,12,Okay. What are some other class norms?
221,13,Sorry.
221,14,"You're good, you're good. What are some other class norms you wanna establish together?"
221,15,"Uh oh. Are we gonna, um, do like any kinda science fair stuff this year has, I've been working with like, um, homemade volcanoes and I just think I, I'd be kinda fun to do in class."
221,16,"Yes. That would be so fun. I definitely agree. I like doing that when I was in elementary school. Um, in my class. We don't do volcanoes since this is English, but you know, definitely in Mr. Nelson's class you'll have your time for volcanoes."
221,17,All right. Yeah.
221,18,What are some other classes?
221,19,"You turn your cell phone off. You do you guys have cell phone? What do you, Hey, don't start with me. Come on. That's starting, finishing."
221,20,"Is there, hi. Is there something going on that you guys wanna guess"
221,21,"Will being well good. Mean being, yeah, <laugh>. That was funny"
221,22,Actually. Do you guys need me to change your seats?
221,23,"Uh, I'll be quiet. Sorry. You're good. You'll be quiet."
221,24,"This behavior is actually something that can help shape our conversation about class norms. So what, what would you guys do if someone in the classroom was bothering you?"
221,25,"That's a good question. Uh oh. So what was I gonna say? Like, are we gonna do like, so will the science fair this year be like competitive or is it just gonna be this class? Do you know anything about that?"
221,26,I don't know
221,27,"Anything about that. I love science. I, I dunno if you could have guessed that by"
221,28,"Now. I love it. I love it. I love science too. It's a great topic. Um, I think there might be a competitive element to it, but you'll have to double check with your"
221,29,"Science. Super competitive is why,"
221,30,"So yeah, that's good. And it's good to have a competitive spirit, but definitely in our classroom we wanna make sure everyone feels welcomed and cared for. So I want you to know that you're all very smart, brilliant students and individuals. So I want, even though I want you guys to get good grades, I want you guys, this"
221,31,Is boring. Why are we doing this? Sorry. That's okay.
221,32,"That's okay. It's okay that this is boring. We just have to get through the boring stuff in order to get to the fun stuff. So once you guys share with me what you want to do as like a class norm, like what type of behavior you guys expect, then we can maybe"
221,33,Like showing up on time. That might be good.
221,34,Showing up on time. Yes. Being punctual. I like that. That's showing respect to me. And as well as your peers. What are some other ones?
221,35,"Uh, will you wanna participate be for the first time? Why don't you participate instead of bugging me? Well, it's too easy. You're too easy at target. What? Oh, do you hear this? I'm being abused. You're, you're abusive. You're abuse. Okay,"
221,36,"We'll end mi Yeah. I need you guys to stop whatever conversation you're having. Hi. Okay, let's take a, let's take a breath and I want you guys to apologize to each other."
221,37,"Sorry. Well, sorry. Yeah. Okay."
221,38,Are you guys gonna be able to get through this class
221,39,"Separate? Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Issue we're working through."
221,40,"Okay, good, good. Well that's definitely something you guys can work on are"
221,41,In simulation.
222,0,Begin simulation.
222,1,Hi class.
222,2,"Hi,"
222,3,"My name is Ms. Kim. Hello, and I'm your teacher today."
222,4,Hi.
222,5,"Hi. So I, today I wanted to go over some behavior expectations. Okay. So these are things that, um, will keep us safe in the classroom and they will help us learn."
222,6,Okay.
222,7,"So the first expectation is if you have a question, I want you to raise your hands. So this way"
222,8,Keep that. Well raise your hand. Okay. Just blur things
222,9,Out. Exactly. Can you try practicing that? Can everybody raise their hands?
222,10,"Oh, raise their hand. Sure. I can do that."
222,11,Great. Sorry.
222,12,Here we go.
222,13,Thank you.
222,14,All
222,15,"Right. So just like that. Oh, if you have a question now you can put your hands down."
222,16,"Well,"
222,17,And if you have a question that is the expectation to raise your hand and then I will call on you.
222,18,All
222,19,"Right. And then you can ask your question. Sorry,"
222,20,I'm getting a text.
222,21,Is everything okay Emily?
222,22,"Yeah, just my mom. Just text. Text him. There we go."
222,23,"Do you need to step out and take care of No,"
222,24,"No, I'm good."
222,25,"Go ahead. Okay. Will I ask you to put your phones away? Um,"
222,26,"Oh. Um, do you think we're gonna do like any kinda like cool science stuff this year? Like, uh, I was making like volcanoes over the holiday and I was thinking like maybe we can make like a, like a competitive volcano kinda competition."
222,27,Do you remember Carlos? What behavior expectation number one is? Okay. What do you do if you have a question?
222,28,"Uh oh, right. Sorry."
222,29,So go ahead and try it. You can
222,30,"Go ahead and try it. Sure, sure. Here it's,"
222,31,"Yes. Carlos, come."
222,32,"Meina,"
222,33,Do you have a question?
222,34,"What? No, he's just, he's just talking. He's very disruptive. No, you sh"
222,35,"Okay. That brings me to, well, behavioral expectations. So Anna and Will, if somebody is talking, it is hard to hear what the other people in the class have to say."
222,36,"Uh,"
222,37,"So expectation number two is if I am talking or your friends are talking that everybody else is listening. Okay. Okay. So we will listen with our ears and we will not talk over each other. Okay. Cause that is the kind and respectful thing to do, right? All"
222,38,Right? Yes. Okay. Yes.
222,39,And my last expectation is I want you guys to remain in your seats until the bell rings.
222,40,Oh. Are you gonna be in charge? Are the science fair? I'm sorry. Yes. Do
222,41,"You know Carlos can't? What is Yes. Sorry. Yes. Carlos, do you have a question?"
222,42,"Yeah, I was just seeing if you, if if we're gonna do like any kinda, uh, science fair stuff this year, I'm kinda like a science junkie."
222,43,Yeah. That's really exciting. I'm gonna take notes on that. And I'm that you are a science junkie and we could definitely address that. Okay. But thank you for sharing that with us.
222,44,"Sure, sure."
222,45,"No problem. Okay, so the three expectations that I have when we meet as a class is two. Can anybody remember the first one?"
222,46,"This is boring. Why are we doing this? Sorry, I forgot."
222,47,"No, I Can you raise your hand, Jaylen ask."
222,48,Oh. Oh boy.
222,49,Go ahead and try it. Yes.
222,50,"Jayla 7,000 today. Yeah."
222,51,"You, you said this was boring. Why are we doing this? Well, it's really important to have expectation. It's very important to do this for two reasons. One, it keeps everybody safe. And two, it's very respectful to learn how to Yeah, well act You"
222,52,"Gotta be respectful. I'm always respectful. Whatcha are you talking about? Well, that's not what I heard. So will trouble last"
222,53,Year or is it Mina? I'm sorry. Nina's. Okay. Nina. Just
222,54,"Try to keep will in line here. Sue, I'm trying to keep in line."
222,55,Remember what expectation number two is.
222,56,I'm sorry. We just have like a checkered history. We kinda get into it a lot.
222,57,"So expectation number two is when somebody is talking, we're remaining quiet. Okay? Okay. So let's not talk over each other. If you have a question or if you want to address the group, you could raise your hand."
222,58,"Oh, we were just arguing. You"
222,59,"Could raise, raise your hand. Mina"
222,60,Simulation.
223,0,And start simulation.
223,1,Hi class. How are you guys doing today?
223,2,"Hey, good, how are you?"
223,3,"I'm good, thank you. We're gonna talk about, um, some behavior expectations for our classroom today. Um, does anyone have one off the top of their head that we should include in our expectations for class?"
223,4,"Um, maybe, uh, you know, show up on time and like, be ready to work."
223,5,"Yeah. Thank you. Well, that's a great one. Um, does everyone agree with that? Does anyone else have something to add?"
223,6,"Well, where's my drink? What do you do with it? I didn't do anything with it. Know, I was just, just,"
223,7,"Hey, will and Nina, let's stand. My drink"
223,8,Is
223,9,"Missing on task, so, um, will,"
223,10,We'll take my drink
223,11,"Coming ready? Jayla, do you have any behavior expectations? Um, from"
223,12,"Classroom? We'll, we'll put my, my drink. I didn't take your drink."
223,13,"Okay, so I'm not sure what happened, but we could use this as an opportunity to talk about an expectation of maybe respecting other people's things. Um, that could be an expectation. Emily, what do you think about that one? Um,"
223,14,"Sorry, my mom just texted me and don't know why. Okay. Putting the phone"
223,15,"Away. Yeah. Thank you Emily. Um, we're gonna keep our phones away in class. Maybe that's another expectation when we come ready for class. Like Will said, that means that we put our away."
223,16,"So I had a quick thing I wanted to mention. So I, I had a, um, I spent some time writing a screenplay about a, a superhero. I, and I was thinking maybe we could do a read through of it. Um, if anyone's up for it."
223,17,"Um, Carlos, that sounds like a really cool idea, but that's not what we're talking about right now. So we can talk about that later. But right now we're talking about behavior expectations for our class. So first we have coming ready to class, which means putting our phones away. Um, and we also talked about respecting seal each other. Yeah. Not taking each other's things. So that would fall under the category of respect each"
223,18,Other. Take agan. Drink Thief on not drink. Thief. Sh
223,19,"Nina. And Will, let's keep talking about behavior expectations. Um, what about using indoor voices in the classroom? Do you guys think that would be a good one to include?"
223,20,"Yeah, definitely."
223,21,Why? Why might we wanna use our indoor voices in the classroom?
223,22,"Um, well I think that, uh, it helps us out. Okay, man. Be under control, listen to each other,"
223,23,"Stuff like that. Definitely. Thank you, Jayla. That's great. Um, so another behavior expectation would be using our indoor voices. So thank you guys for being, doing a good job and listening to what, what Jayla said. That could be another expectation that we should always remember to be quiet when other people are speaking in class. Definitely. Um, Carlos, why do you think we would wanna"
223,24,"Do that? What about, um, are we having a science fair this year? Cause I heard we're gonna have a science fair and I have some great idea. Yes. So"
223,25,"That's awesome. But again, we are going to stay on task with what we're doing right now, talking about behavior ex ations. So Carlos,"
223,26,"I said I'm psych about the science, just listening."
223,27,"That's awesome. Okay, well, what, why might we wanna listen to each other when everyone else, when someone else is speaking? Carlos?"
223,28,"I'm just gonna,"
223,29,"Or Emily? Yes, Emily, go ahead."
223,30,"Yeah. Um, well we all will get to listen to each other and it's pretty, I don't know, it's always better in a conversation if we're listening instead of just talking over."
223,31,"Yeah,"
223,32,"Definitely. Yeah. Well, wait a minute, this is boring. Why are we doing this?"
223,33,"So we're talking about behavior expectations because it's a great way for us all to be on the same page about how to act in class so that our class will run smoothly and that everyone will be respectful of each other and our time and our classroom tools. Um, so that's, that's why we're doing this. Jayla."
223,34,"Okay. Yeah. I just lost my place, so."
223,35,"Nope, that's okay. Does anyone else have another behavior expectation? Um,"
223,36,"My expectation is, is, uh, will doesn't steal things. It's from Yeah, my expectation is you don't lie about me stealing things. Well, my expectation is you, Nina,"
223,37,"And don't lie Isaac up here, please. Okay, thank you."
223,38,"Oh,"
223,39,"So we've come up with some awesome behavior expectations for our class. We talked about listening when each other, when, when another person is speaking. We talked about using our indoor voices, um, uh, respecting each other and showing up on time for class. I think that this is an awesome list, um, of behavior expectations. So if we all make an effort to follow them, I think that our school year will, um, be that much better. Does that sound like a good plan to, to"
223,40,You guys? Yeah. Sounds good.
223,41,Great. So did anyone do anything fun over the weekend that they wanna share
223,42,And simulation.
224,0,And start simulation.
224,1,"Hi. Good morning, class. How are you guys?"
224,2,"Hi there. Good, good."
224,3,"Um, so today we're gonna talk about some behavioral expectations. So I'm gonna, um, give you guys some examples of some, and then we're gonna talk about why you think those might be important."
224,4,Okay.
224,5,"So my first expectation for you guys is to use kind words. Yeah. So why do you think that might be important? Well,"
224,6,"You took my pen. No, I didn't. I didn't take a pen. Oh, you, you did. Hey, Mina, you totally, where is it? I can't find it. Oh. Uh, didn't take, take it. We're doing."
224,7,"Hey, Mina."
224,8,"No,"
224,9,"Stop talking to right now, having this discussion"
224,10,Thief.
224,11,"All let's, let's focus back in. Why do you guys think, um, using kind words might be important?"
224,12,"Um, well, oh, oh, sorry. Um, well, it helps to, we help, uh, like support each other that way, I would say."
224,13,"Yeah, exactly. Jayla. Um, sorry. So that Hey, Emily."
224,14,Yes.
224,15,"Stop using your phone right now. Okay. Let's just put it away. Thank you. Let's focus back in on our discussion. That was a great answer, Jayla. Um, thanks. So it will help us build a stronger classroom community when we use kind words with each other."
224,16,"Oh, I wanted to mention, um, so I wrote a, a screenplay based upon, uh, one of these superheroes that I like to make up at my spare time. And I didn't know if anyone wanted to like, do a readthrough of it, uh, later on or something. I just kinda have this new project. I'd love to get everyone at all."
224,17,"Okay, Carlos, thanks. Thanks for sharing that with us. Let's stay, let's sure. Uh, stay on track and maybe we can talk about that some later. Alright, so my next,"
224,18,I got the com I have the copies for
224,19,Everyone. Okay. My next behavioral expectation is to make
224,20,Your
224,21,Pen safe choices.
224,22,"Well, you totally took my pen. I saw"
224,23,"Hey, will and Mina."
224,24,Yeah. Sorry.
224,25,"Let's focus in on discussion and not talk, not talk to each other."
224,26,She said not to talk will. Okay.
224,27,Sure. Okay. Thank you guys. So make safe choices. Why do you think that might be important?
224,28,"Um, well, did you say make safe choices? Is that what you said? Yep. Um, well, you know, we wanna be able to do well and not put ourselves at risk. I don't, I don't"
224,29,Know. Yeah. What are some examples of some safe choices?
224,30,"Um, not running or throwing thin things or calling anyone a name. It's, yeah. Unflattering."
224,31,"Exactly. Emily, that's an awesome answer. So just using our materials and our bodies responsibly in the"
224,32,"Classroom. Oh, I meant to ask. What about, uh, the science fair this year? Are you in charge of that? Or who is charge of Carlos? Like a science junkie?"
224,33,We're gonna
224,34,Science junkie
224,35,"Are some, those are some good questions, some good points to bring up. But right now we're gonna focus on talking about Okay. Some of our expectations."
224,36,Cool.
224,37,"Um, all ears. Okay. My third one that I wanna talk about with you guys is to listen while others are speaking. And why do you think that one might be important?"
224,38,"Um, because, uh, we'll, we'll, we'll be able to learn from each other and, um, hear each other's like thoughts and opinion opinions and share ideas."
224,39,Yeah.
224,40,This is boring. Why aren't we doing this? Sorry.
224,41,"That's okay. Why? Um, we're doing this so that we can build a stronger community as a classroom. And like Will said, we have a lot to learn from each other. Um, and so that's a, that's why we're talking about kind of our expectations for the classroom so that we can make sure everyone has, um, a good experience in class every day. Okay. That we can learn how to work together."
224,42,All right.
224,43,But great answer. Will.
224,44,"I think something should be don't steal. What do you think? Will, I think you're just being mean. Hey, Nina, which part of your name"
224,45,"Will Hey, will"
224,46,What? Sorry.
224,47,"Let's focus back in and we can have a discussion about the pencil stealing incident later, but let's focus in right now on our expectations. Okay. And I understand that you guys are frustrated about that, but remember that one of our expectations we just talked about was use kind words. So we'll talk a little bit more with"
224,48,"That, a few grades,"
224,49,"And that's okay. That's okay. And that's why we're gonna have a discussion about it later. Um, does anyone else have,"
224,50,"And, and okay."
225,0,Begin simulation.
225,1,Hi class.
225,2,"Hi,"
225,3,I'm Ms. [inaudible] and I'm so excited to be your teacher this year.
225,4,Hi there.
225,5,"I just wanted I first, um, I wanted to, um, talk about some classroom rules."
225,6,Okay.
225,7,So the first one I wanna go over is to use kind words. Why do you think we should use kind words?
225,8,"Um, well, you took my pen. Take your pen. No, Nina. No, it's not here. You took it. Yeah."
225,9,"Sorry. Let's, we're talking about classroom rules, so we, we don't even need our pens right now. Okay."
225,10,Okay.
225,11,"So why Nina? Why, why is it important to use kind words?"
225,12,"Um, well, I think that'll help us, um, work together better."
225,13,"Yes, of course. Yeah. We wanna be kind to each other because we feel it, it will make us feel good about ourselves."
225,14,"Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry."
225,15,"Um, so the second one I want to make sure we remember is to, to be safe in the classroom. What does be safe mean?"
225,16,"Um, be like respectful of people's space, right? Oh, I meant to say, I'm sorry. But, um, they're working on a screenplay, uh, with these like superheroes I really like, and I was just thinking if anybody wanted to workshop it. Um, I've got several copies on me, so if anyone wants to do a read through, just Paula."
225,17,"Okay. I, your idea sounds awesome, Carlos, but we are, we are talking about our classroom rules right now. Okay. There will be another time to have those conversations. So why is it important to keep safe in the classroom?"
225,18,"Well, so people take your pen. I didn't take your pen."
225,19,"Stop. So we wanna make sure, Mina, I just want me, we wanna make sure that we have safe hands and safe feet in the classroom so that everyone is comfortable and we are in a comfortable and safe place to learn,"
225,20,Okay?
225,21,"Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And the next one is follow directions. So it's important that we follow directions in class. So what does that mean, Jayla? I haven't heard from you."
225,22,"Yeah. Um, well maybe like just, uh, follow directions, just sort of, you know, if we have an assignment, we should do it right. Um, and, you know, have it done on time and do our best. All that stuff. Yeah."
225,23,Cool. Yeah. Anyone else?
225,24,"Uh oh. Are you gonna be in charge of the science fair this year? Because I have some amazing ideas and I didn't know if you like, had any info on that."
225,25,"Carlos, I am so excited to hear your amazing ideas, but cool. Right now we're talking about classroom roles. Um, so I wanna hear from you. What, what, what does following directions look like in the classroom?"
225,26,"Um, well, like if you tell us to be quiet, probably be quiet. Yeah. Although sometimes"
225,27,When the teacher told you something to do to make sure you follow her direction. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> great. Yeah.
225,28,"And if you're working in a group, you know, like work together, right? Stuff"
225,29,"Like that. I really, I really like that."
225,30,"This is boring. So it's Jayla, why are we doing this? This"
225,31,Jayla? Yeah.
225,32,This is boring. Why are we doing this?
225,33,"Well, it's very important that we're in school to to, to have a, a good place to learn and for us to feel comfortable in the classroom because this is where we're gonna be the majority of our day. And I wanna make sure that everyone is, it, it, this is feels comfortable and, and it's gonna be a, a fun place to learn. Kick me and we can"
225,34,"Have kicking you because you stole my pen. I didn't steal it. Stop telling me that. Well,"
225,35,You're Nina
225,36,Will. Nice. What are you doing? I'm just calling things the way I see
225,37,Nina and Will.
225,38,Yep.
225,39,"It is not okay to, it is not okay to kick. We need to remember to keep our, our hands and feet to ourselves. Okay. Um, so will you need to make sure you to return the pen? And honestly, we to right now we're working on cla we're talking about classroom rules. Yeah. So we shouldn't have anything out right now. Okay? Okay."
225,40,See?
225,41,Okay. And.
226,0,Begin simulation.
226,1,Hello class.
226,2,Hello. Hi.
226,3,Hi. My name is Ms. Goff. How are you?
226,4,Good. Doing good. How are you?
226,5,"Great. I am doing well. So today we're gonna talk about setting some classroom expectations. So the first one is to be respectful. So raise your hand if you think you know what that means. Well,"
226,6,"Where's my pen? I didn't pick your, take your pen."
226,7,Mina. Hi Mina. Do you know what that means? To be respectful?
226,8,"Um, yeah, to like, uh, be nice to other people who don't steal your things."
226,9,"So yes, to be respectful of means being nice to other people. What about which people? Which people should you be nice to in the classroom?"
226,10,"Well, everybody."
226,11,Everybody? Yes. So your classmates and your teachers. Oh
226,12,No. Oh no.
226,13,"Emily, please turn your cell cell phone off."
226,14,Okay. Turning it off. Turning it off. Turning to get off.
226,15,"Thank you. Besides people, what other things should be we consider when we're being respectful? Should you leave a mess in your classroom?"
226,16,"Oh, no."
226,17,No. Definitely not. So clean up your space?
226,18,Yeah.
226,19,And
226,20,"Oh, oh, oh, oh. So I wanted to mention, so I've been working on this really cool, um, like superhero, uh, short play and I didn't know if anybody wanted to do a read through one of my drafts. Um, I don't know if you know the schedule's like today, but just putting"
226,21,"Out That's me, Carlos. Let's talk about that at the end of class."
226,22,"Okay, great. Sounds good. Works for me."
226,23,"All right, so the next one is be responsible. So what does it mean to be responsible as a student?"
226,24,"To not steal, not I didn't steal anything. I don't know where you're getting this from. I don't even use a pen."
226,25,"Well, Mina. Okay."
226,26,Look at a lie. Detective up in here. Yep.
226,27,"So being responsible, what does that mean to you? Um, besides not stealing from your classmates?"
226,28,"Besides, yeah. Theft. Um, I would say like doing your work on time, participating, stuff like"
226,29,"That. Yeah. And coming to class prepared. What is, what does it mean to be coming to class prepared? Um, what should you have with"
226,30,Your reading or your homework done?
226,31,What else? What else did you have?
226,32,"Yeah,"
226,33,"Will, what else did you have besides your homework or your reading?"
226,34,"Um, I guess to contribute to like conversations and stuff about the material. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> or whatever. Mm-hmm."
226,35,<affirmative>. Yeah. So be ready to share and contribute to conversations. You should also bring a pen or a pencil.
226,36,"Oh, are you in charge of the science fair this year? Because I heard that like there's a new science fair person."
226,37,"Yes. Carlos. Uh, actually I am. But let's talk about that after class. I'd love to talk to you more about that. Okay. Let's, uh, let's focus on the classroom expectations right"
226,38,Now. Okay. Thank you. Cool. I'm just excited as
226,39,You can tell. I can tell. So the next one is be kind. What does it mean to be kind Emily?
226,40,"Yeah, to like, uh, listen when other people talk and to, I don't know, respect people's opinions. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?"
226,41,"So Jayla, we are doing this so that everyone knows how to behave in the classroom and so that we can all work together as a community."
226,42,Yeah.
226,43,Yeah. So what does it mean to you to be kind?
226,44,"Um, I think well being able to like listen to other people's opinions. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> maybe you don't agree with,"
226,45,Right? Yeah. So even if you disagree with
226,46,"Someone, people didn't accuse me listen to them stealing when I didn't steal. Well you did. You did buddy. You did. Will you notice will name is you ever think it's cuz you're mean Will. Yeah."
226,47,Will please be quiet
226,48,All
226,49,Thank you will Amina we'll talk after we're done. So the last one is be polite. What does it mean to be polite?
226,50,"Um, to like, like with your turn, like if you're waiting in line, uh, like yeah. Um, helping people who need help."
226,51,"Great. Sure. Yeah. So waiting your turn. So if you have something to share with the class, you could raise your hand. Learn simulation."
227,0,And start simulation.
227,1,Hi class.
227,2,Hi.
227,3,"Hi. Okay, so today we're gonna be going over the norms that we established in the classroom. Um, the first one that we said that we were gonna put in the classroom is to respect each other and to be kind. And so can someone gimme an example of that? Norm?"
227,4,"I'm sorry. Uh, you said be respectful and"
227,5,Be kind. Yeah. Respect each other and be kind. Yeah.
227,6,"Um, I think maybe if people don steal other people's pencils, like Will here, I think that may might be a good place to start. I didn't sue your pencil or pen or ready your pencils. Okay."
227,7,Nina.
227,8,She did.
227,9,"Nina, I think that is a good example, but how about if there's something between you and Will? We can talk about that later. Is that okay?"
227,10,Okay.
227,11,"Okay. Yeah, that's, that's a good example, right? We don't wanna take each other's stuff. We wanna respect each other's stuff. Right."
227,12,Sorry.
227,13,"You're okay. Are you okay, Emily?"
227,14,"Yeah, I could just, I'll turn my phone off."
227,15,"Okay. Yes. If you could take, if you could put away your phone. Yeah. Yep. Okay. And then our second norm was listen and raise your hand if you wanna speak. Right. Um, what if Jayla was talking and Will and Emily were just, you know, talking to their neighbors? Is that okay?"
227,16,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Mm-hmm. <affirmative> now?
227,17,Yeah. Do you wanna listen to Distracting?
227,18,Yeah.
227,19,Distracting.
227,20,"Yeah. Oh, oh, oh. So I wanted to just mention, I wrote this really cool, um, short play about superheroes, um, and I wanted to see if anybody wanted to do a readthrough of it. Just sort of like workshopping a script."
227,21,"Carlos, that's awesome. But right now we're talking about our norms, so let's talk about that later. Is that okay?"
227,22,"Okay. That's, that's"
227,23,"Fine. Okay. Thank you. For sure. Okay. Um, so we, we established the first one. Respect each other and be kind. And the second yay"
227,24,"Pen thief. I didn't do it. I didn't, I don't need a"
227,25,Pen. Nina will stop talking and please listen. Thank you. Okay. And so our third norm that we wanna go over is be safe. What does that look like in the classroom?
227,26,"Um, I think can't get back. Not running, not touching other people's things. Yeah. He's just respecting speaks. Yeah. Speaks of other people."
227,27,"Is it okay if we kind of like touch each other and push each other or do something? Oh, no. Physical. That's not okay. Right? That's not being safe, right?"
227,28,No. We're like playing tag or something.
227,29,"Do you wanna play tag inside the classroom? No. No. Right. Yeah. It could cause people to fall. You can run into desks, chairs, and then you guys could get hurt, right? Yep. Okay, so, so those are the three norms that we established. Can some of you maybe share what we"
227,30,"Oh, oh, oh. Are you in charge of the science fair this year? Cause like someone told me that, that our teacher was, and I don't know who is, but I have like, so many good ideas. Carlos,"
227,31,"We are talking about our norms right now, and we'll talk about the sides here later. I know you're excited so we can talk about it later. Okay. Cool. Cool. Okay, so like I said, can someone maybe tell us what we went over about the norms?"
227,32,"Um, to be safe?"
227,33,"Mm-hmm. <affirmative> and respectful. Yes. Be kind. Yes. And what was the second one that we talked about? About talking? Um,"
227,34,Don't interact.
227,35,"Yeah, you wanna listen and raise your hand, right? Yeah. Okay. So that's basically our norms for the classroom."
227,36,This is boring. Is it boring?
227,37,"Okay. Well, we're done with it anyway, so, oh, yeah. <laugh>, what did you guys, what did you guys do over the weekend? Or what are you guys gonna do?"
227,38,"Um, probably getting a, like a hang out at the park. My dog. Yeah. Um, stuff like that."
227,39,That sounds awesome.
227,40,"Yeah, I have a, I have like a, like a keep bees. My dad's like a scientist. Hello? Hello? I usually play with the bees. Wow."
227,41,Weird. Do you get to wear a suit?
227,42,You steal the deep bees from your dad?
227,43,Nina.
227,44,Who still bees.
227,45,Nina?
227,46,Yeah.
227,47,Sorry. We said to be kind so we're not gonna talk to Will like that in
227,48,"The classroom. Okay. Well, Nina,"
227,49,What are you gonna do this
227,50,Week? We have issues.
227,51,"That's fine, Nina. Yeah, let's not be, let's not be disrespectful to each other, okay? Okay. Yeah. I'll"
227,52,Let go. I'll let go of
227,53,"It. Thank you. We can talk about it later. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Nina, what are you gonna do this weekend?"
227,54,"Oh, neat. Oh, I was gonna go to brunch with my mom. Ooh, that should be fun."
227,55,"Yeah, some grapes. Brunch is awesome. Yeah."
227,56,Oh
227,57,"Yeah. What's your favorite, favorite type of food?"
227,58,"Um, any simulation."
228,0,We start simulation.
228,1,"Hi everybody, I'm Ms. Murphy."
228,2,Hey.
228,3,"Hi. Hi there. So I just wanted to review some of our expectations in our classroom today. So, uh, the first one I'm thinking of is raising your hand. That's a pretty big one, wouldn't you say? Why is that important? That we raise our hand in the classroom. Yeah, Jayla."
228,4,"Oh, it helps. I think everybody, um, maintain order."
228,5,"Yeah, totally. What else? Well,"
228,6,"Well, why didn't you raise your hand? We've been working on, on you being a little bit, you know, more demonstrative."
228,7,"Mina, do you have something you're saying over there?"
228,8,"Me alone? Oh, sorry. We're just trying to get will out of his shell."
228,9,"Oh, well that's nice. Nice for you to think of him, but yeah. Well, I think, are you good to go? Will you don't have anything you wanna add?"
228,10,No. Okay.
228,11,That's
228,12,Alright. Embarrassed.
228,13,"No, you're fine. So, um, something that's also important."
228,14,Sorry.
228,15,"You're good. Something that's also important is being quiet when others are speaking. Sorry,"
228,16,Text.
228,17,"All right. Yeah, Emily, we'll have to put that away. So, thank you. So when others are speaking, we should be quiet and that makes a lot of sense. Why is that? Anybody have an idea?"
228,18,"Well, I think, uh, oh. Oh, oh, oh."
228,19,Remember to raise
228,20,"Your hand. Just talk about, um, really quickly. Um, I had this idea. Do, do we maybe wanna have a, like a sort of a, like a superhero discussion at all? Um, I'd really love to make them up. So I was just seeing anybody was"
228,21,"Interested that that's a cool idea, but not for right now. Okay, Carlos. Okay."
228,22,Okay.
228,23,Yes. We'll talk about that another time.
228,24,Sorry for not raising my hand here.
228,25,"Thank you for saying that. Yep. That's an important thing to raise your hand. Um, and you know, sometimes if you have a question that you just wanna check with a friend really quick. Well, did"
228,26,You take
228,27,My pencil? It's easier just to raise your hand and then everyone can hear the answer. I didn't take pencil.
228,28,"We'll take my pencil. I think I know. Well,"
228,29,"We'll have to, we'll have to address that in a little bit. Okay. Oh, so we still have one more thing we're we're talking about. Okay. Which is okay. Our third expectation is that we have safe bodies in the classroom. What does that mean, you think? To be safe with how your body is in the classroom? Yeah. Jail."
228,30,"Um, um, I think, you know, be respectful of people's space and, uh, no running. Don't take people's in still."
228,31,Yeah. Those are great points.
228,32,Stuff like
228,33,"That. Yes, exactly. Yeah. Running is just for outside or at pe Yep. And inside the classroom we should be walking or sometimes if we have like a little dance, we'll"
228,34,"Do so. Oh, oh, oh. Oh. Are you gonna run the science fair this year? Cause I heard, I heard you're gonna do that. Am I totally wrong"
228,35,"About that? Carlos? Carlos, what are you forgetting right now? Forgetting to go."
228,36,Alrighty.
228,37,Raising your hand. Yep. I'll talk about the sides for later. Okay.
228,38,"Okay, good. There you go. I'll not forget next time."
228,39,"Thank you. Good. Um, and then how's, how's everybody's, um, week been going? Uh, like how was your morning? This morning?"
228,40,What's that? I'm sorry.
228,41,How was your morning? This morning? What's something that you did while you were home? Did anybody read me cool books lately?
228,42,"Oh, what is boring? Why are we doing this again?"
228,43,Was that well Or Carlos? I didn't see
228,44,"No, it's, it's Jayla."
228,45,"Jayla. Oh, sorry. I'm curious. Right, the middle. What were you saying? Jayla?"
228,46,"Oh, I was just saying this is boring. Why are we doing this?"
228,47,"I'm just talking about books that we've read. Okay. Yeah. I mean, Jayla, I know you like to read just as much as anyone else, right?"
228,48,"Oh, I do. No, this is true. This is true. Well, what"
228,49,Have you been reading?
228,50,"Um, pretty much like a lot of biographies. Okay, cool. Who take your pen. Who were they about? Yes, you did. You're thief. You're a pen thief."
228,51,Mina.
228,52,"Well, yeah, not a thief. They're"
228,53,Just Hey guys. Humiliating
228,54,"Me. Actively humiliating me in class. Well,"
228,55,"Hey, will and Mina. Yeah, Jayla was trying to share something and one of our expectations is to listen and, and to be quiet while others are speaking. And if you have something that you wanna share, you can raise your hand."
228,56,"Sorry. Sorry,"
228,57,"Jayla. So Jayla, can you tell me about, uh, the biographies you you've been reading?"
228,58,"Oh, so, um, I read one on like, uh, Sam Ronald Reagan. Cool. I was like, well, I was like, what's this, what's this guy about? Yeah. Someone talks about the eighties and stuff."
228,59,"Yes. He learned lot and, and he."
229,0,Are you ready?
229,1,"Yes. Okay. The simulation. Okay. Hello everybody. Hello. Okay, so before we start class, just wanna go over a few things that we kind of had some struggles with this week. And just wanna remind us, cause things happen over the weekend. So remember Okay.

301,5,"Um, today we're gonna go over our classroom expectations. Um, so I'm gonna give an example and then we'll have a chance to talk about how we might show these. Um, so one of our, um, classroom expectations is that we all show respect for others. So some examples of showing respect are raising the hand, your hand when you want to speak, using kind words and listening to the teacher and other students when they're speaking. Would anyone like to share any other examples of how to show respect for others? You could raise your hand if you want to share."
301,6,"I am sitting sitting, but I just, just a little bit have to pay attention."

301,11,"Ok,"
301,12,"Sorry. Um, sorry."

301,14,"Way, just put it away. Sorry. Sorry. That's ok."
301,15,"That's alright. That's something that we all have to get used to being at school and not at home anymore. So, is your phone off and a way?"
301,16,"Yes, yes. Yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
301,17,"So we'll go ahead and add that to our way to show respect and, um, will, I'd like you to help me out with showing an example with your body."
301,18,"Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just wanted, that's"
301,19,"So we'll go ahead and add, um, sitting up straight."

301,30,"Oh no, I was gonna suggest a, a norm. Um, okay. I was gonna say, you know, showing up on time is good, I think and being ready Oh. To like, work"
301,31,Showing up on time and being ready to work. I love that. Love that. I think that fits under our respect category. So I'll put it on
301,32,"There. Oh yeah, I saw, so I, I finally get to see Ironman the other day, which was really cool. Um, that, that Robert Downey do something. Uh, so <laugh> just wanted to mention that. I don't know if anybody else saw it. Maybe I'm behind here. Uh, I got just, just kind of got a superhero movie, so that sounds, sounds great. Not really knowledgeable, but Sure, sure."
301,33,"I appreciate you wanting to share some of your, um, experiences with the No"
301,34,Problem.
301,35,"At the end of the day, we'll have a little go around or we can't share something that went well and something we're looking forward to. And maybe at that point, anyone else is gonna go see that movie can share that. So we're gonna move on to the next norm, which is safety and some ways of making sure that everybody's safe is, um, always using kind words, listening to instructions from adults at the school and keeping a safe body, like walking feet in the classrooms and the hallways. Yes. Emily, thank you for raising your hand. I"
301,36,Was gonna say also like not running maybe in class.
301,37,"Yes, definitely not running. So that's why I would say walking feet because it kind of helps if you remember what you're supposed to do. So instead of running, we're gonna Right. And how about when our in, when we're in our chairs, Mina what can do while we're in our chairs"
301,38,"Book report. Do what are you talking about? Oh, I was just asking Will if there was a book report due this week. Um, okay. I I think it's on vacation,"
301,39,"So. Okay, good. Uh, Mina, do you have any ways that you can think of making sure that we're safe in the past?"
301,40,"This is boring. This is boring. Why are we doing, doing this?"
301,41,"Yeah. I'm Kayla. At the beginning of the year, we kind of do have to go over just some of the norms and expectations, which could be a review for you, especially since you've been in the school a few years. So we'll just more minutes to make sure we're all on the same page. If not everybody knows all the same things that you do about it."
301,42,Okay? Okay. No problem. Any
301,43,Other ideas about how we can stay safe in school?
301,44,"Hey, there. All right. We're."
302,0,"Um, so here we go. Okay. Uh, begin simulation."
302,1,"Hello. Hello. So, um, today we'll set a customer. So does um, anyone have any thoughts? How is she?"
302,2,Ow.
302,3,"I'm sitting. I am sitting up. Sitting up. Okay. I, I just,"
302,4,Maya and Ru
302,5,Quiet.
302,6,You are safe. Focus.
302,7,"Sorry, sorry. I'm just trying to wake him up. <laugh>."
302,8,"So first for our classroom, we'll be respectful for each other."
302,9,Okay.
302,10,"Sorry. I'm sorry. My mom is sending me a text. Sorry, sorry. Sorry about that. Oops. I wonder if I forgot something at home."
302,11,"Hey, Emily, you can put your phone away for now."
302,12,Okay. Okay. Sorry.
302,13,"And for a second, um, we'll be always kind to others like your friends and teacher."
302,14,Mm-hmm.
302,15,"<affirmative>, what do you guys think about this? Do you guys agree with this? Sorry."
302,16,"Oh yeah. Sorry, I'm just, uh, I'm getting a little tired here. Apologize. I'm just, I know."
302,17,Hmm.
302,18,"Okay. Um, um, next for third, um, we'll be open-minded. And for last one, uh, you guys will always clean your area. So what do you guys think about this? Our four"
302,19,"Class? Are you gonna come tonight? Birthday party? Can I, um, yeah, yeah, that's, it's the trampoline part."
302,20,"Um,"
302,21,"Yeah,"
302,22,You guys this after class.
302,23,"Oh, okay. Sorry, we were just talking about my birthday. Sorry about that. Sorry. It's fine."
302,24,"Um,"
302,25,"Oh, um,"
302,26,"Yes, Jayla?"
302,27,"Yes. I think a classroom norm that would be great, would be, um, showing up on time, um, yeah. And being ready to work every day."
302,28,Yes. Showing up on time is good. Okay. So that will be our fifth classroom. Okay. Does anyone else have other thoughts or opinion?
302,29,"Um, well, you know, I saw Ironman the other day finally, and let me tell you what a movie, what a performance by Bob Downey and, uh, wow. Just, I loved it. I don't know if you've seen it, but I highly recommend it. Um, gonna check out the sequels tonight."
302,30,"Yes. I'll see. I'll see you later so we can talk about, okay,"
302,31,"That's fine. Okay,"
302,32,"So I'll go over, yes, Emily?"
302,33,"Yeah. I think a good classroom norm would be, um, I think being, uh, always paying attention and never like interrupting other people maybe. Yeah."
302,34,"Yeah. That's good. Always pay attention when others talking. That's a good one. Oh, we have,"
302,35,"What about the book report? Is there a book report? Do No, it was just vacation."
302,36,"So Will Amaya, can you guys, oh,"
302,37,Sorry.
302,38,Can you guys stay
302,39,"Focus? Yes, yes. No problem. Sorry, <inaudible>."
302,40,"So Will, what do you think about our class more?"
302,41,"Um, I think they're great. I think they're great. Good to be here. This is boring. Why are we doing this?"
302,42,"Um, we're doing this because, so we can, um, be more engaged in class and be more respect to each other for"
302,43,"Ah,"
302,44,The future.
302,45,"Okay. I'm just checking. Just checking. All right. Well,"
303,0,So begin simulation. Hello.
303,1,Hi guys. Welcome to class.
303,2,Hello.
303,3,"Today we're,"
303,4,Hi.
303,5,"Today we're gonna be talking about some expectations that we have when we come back to class. So the first thing that we need to do is make sure that we're bringing our attention to class and we're ready to learn. That means that we're gonna stay in our learning space and in our learning area, which is our desks. We're gonna make sure that we have"
303,6,"Sit up. Nina. I'm sitting, sitting up. Yeah. Here. Sorry. Sit up."
303,7,Make sure we're bringing our learning attitudes to class.
303,8,Okay.
303,9,"So after we have, we make sure our desks are set up. Everybody has their papers and their name tags, and they're ready to go. Now we're gonna make sure we're listening the first time when we're asked to do something. So when I ask you to do something,"
303,10,"Oh, my mom is sending me a text. I'm sorry. I wonder if I forgot something home."
303,11,Emily. We have to make sure we are bringing our attention to the work and that we're staying in the workplace mindset. And we're here to focus. Okay.
303,12,Sorry.
303,13,"So when you're asked to do something the first time, make sure that you follow directions and you listen and do it to the best of your ability. Just like Emily just did when I asked her her first time to put her phone away and stay focused, she listened to me, will a part of our staying in our workplace and being ready to work. Cause that was sitting up straight and we're"
303,14,"Sorry. Focused. Sorry. I was just really tired. I, I sit up way too late last night. I'm sorry. Sorry."
303,15,"Well, I'm glad you're bringing your learning attitude and listening to me. The first time I tell you to sit up, the next thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna leave all of the crazy things that we did over the weekend or at home, at the door, and we're"
303,16,"Gonna come to the birthday, birthday party. Yes. It's, it's a jump. Oh, yes, yes."
303,17,"Everything at home, at the door. And we're here to learn and we're here to talk with each other about school and bring our attention to school."
303,18,Okay. Sorry.
303,19,"So the next thing that we need to do to make sure we're ready to learn is that when we're talking to each other, we're only talking about classwork or schoolwork, and we're listening to each other and giving each other good feedback. Yeah. Jayla, what's your question?"
303,20,"Um, I'm just gonna say, I think one norm it would be good would be like to, you know, um, not just show up on time, but um, just be ready to work every day. Like, have your reading done and just be ready to go."
303,21,"Absolutely. That's a great idea. I'm so glad you shared that with everyone and you listened and were active in our discussion. Just like Jayla said, it's,"
303,22,"Oh, I wanted to mention, um, you know, I was finally able to see Ironman over the weekend and lemme tell you what a what a film it was. Carlos."
303,23,"I'm glad, I'm glad to see Ironman. But we have to remember we're talking about classwork and school and class. Uhhuh."
303,24,<affirmative> and
303,25,Time to talk about Ironman at lunch. Just not right now.
303,26,Okay. Gotcha. Gotcha. I'll be ready. I'll be ready guys.
303,27,"So yeah, just like Jayla said, we're gonna make sure that we all come to class prepared with our work done and we're ready to discuss it and, yep. Emily, what's your question?"
303,28,"I think, uh, a good norm would be like to make sure you're safe around your fellow classmates. It's like you don't run or throw things or no horse horseplay."
303,29,"Yeah, Emily, that's perfect. We wanna make sure that we're always focused on what we're doing and we're not being crazy in the classroom. It's unsafe. Like Emily's mad when we're running around and being crazy. We have to bring our classroom behavior. Yep. Will, do you have a"
303,30,"Question? Was there a book report? Do you mean to No, just got back from vacation. Will I thought there was a book report. Yes. I'm sorry, I was just confused as usual. <laugh>, sorry."
303,31,Have something due. I'll make sure to communicate with that. That
303,32,"Was good. Okay, good. Good. That's"
303,33,"Good. And we'll make sure that we don't have to ask our friends in class, so,"
303,34,Cool. Cool.
303,35,Yeah. And then last thing that we wanna make sure we're doing is that we're raising our hands when we wanna talk.
303,36,This is boring. Why are we doing this?
303,37,"Jayla? It's important to talk about these things so that when we're learning, we are all focused on what we're doing and we're making the most of our time together."
303,38,Okay. Okay. Gotcha.
303,39,"So yes, like I said earlier, it's important that we're raising our hand when we're talking and we're not blurting out in class and that we make sure we know when we're supposed to be talking. So,"
303,40,All right.
304,0,"And, uh, we will begin simulation."
304,1,Hi guys. Welcome back. Hi.
304,2,How are
304,3,You? All?
304,4,Good. Good. Good. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>
304,5,Good. It's good to see you guys again.
304,6,Hello.
304,7,"Well, this morning we are going to establish our classroom norms. So first of all, um, the first one is to be respectful. So raise your hand if you know what that means. What does it mean to be respectful?"
304,8,"Um, oh, will sit up. I'm slu."
304,9,"Hey, will."
304,10,"Oh yeah, sure. Sorry, I just thought it what was falling asleep again."
304,11,"Oh, gotcha. So, Mina, do you have any ideas for what it means to be respectful?"
304,12,"Um hmm. Uh, I think sitting up straight, that's a good start."
304,13,"Yeah, that's a good one. Um, when I think of being respectful, I think it's good to keep our hands to ourselves."
304,14,"Oh, sorry. Sorry, my mom is sending me a text. Sorry. Sorry. I wonder if I forgot something at home. <laugh>, sorry."
304,15,"Hey, Emily, I think we should look at that when we have a break."
304,16,Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.
304,17,"That's okay. All. So, I want you guys to keep your hands to ourselves and we also want to listen when someone else is talking. So that means if I'm talking Hey, will, what will, are you okay? Who?"
304,18,"Oh, I'm sorry. I just, I'm sorry. I just dozed off. I just, uh, I was up late watching Star Trek, sorry."
304,19,"Oh, gotcha. Maybe during our break late."
304,20,"Okay. Well, yeah. Sorry, it's on me. Sorry. <laugh>."
304,21,"All right. So we wanna, we wanna listen respectfully and so when other people are talking, wanna make sure our voices are off. We wanna give them our listening here."
304,22,"You gonna come to my birthday? You do. Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm coming. Oh, Kayla, sorry. Sorry. Yes."
304,23,"We're talking about how we wanna, we wanna be quiet when other people are talking, so if you have something to say, I want you to raise your hand."
304,24,Okay. Sorry. Sorry. It's
304,25,"Okay. Sorry. It's okay. Um, another one? Yes. So another one is to raise your hand when you want to talk and you have to wait to be called on."
304,26,Mm-hmm.
304,27,"<affirmative>. So if anyone has anything to say or you have any questions. Yes, Jayla. Good job. Yeah,"
304,28,"I was just gonna say, a norm that would be really good would be like, showing up on time and also like having, you know, your work ready, whether it's like reading or, or homework, you know, and just being ready to give it your all."
304,29,"Yeah. I love that. Thank you so much, Shayla. That's another really good one. Sure. Make sure we're ready to work. We have all of our materials ready. So your notebook, your pencil, your homework."
304,30,"Oh, I wanted to mention, you know, I saw Ironman finally over the weekend. You know, I've heard so much about it and, and I'm hooked. I cannot wait to see, you know, I, I guess there's sequels and there's crossovers. Yeah. And you know, there's a whole universe. And let me tell you, um, I'm in, I'm in, I dunno if you've all seen it. I know. I'm kinda late to the game here. Probably 10 years, but nothing. Alright,"
304,31,"Let's, I think we should talk about that later during our break cause"
304,32,"We talk. Gotcha. I'll be ready. I'll be ready. No problem. Yeah,"
304,33,"That's a good one. Um, yeah. Emily, do you wanna say something?"
304,34,"Oh, I was gonna say, uh, a good norm would be like being careful around people and like, you know, not running or throwing things or, uh, just being respectful, physically respectful with people."
304,35,That is a great one. Thank you Emily for sharing that. Sure. It's very important we don't run in the classroom so no one falls or hurt themselves or hurts other people. And
304,36,"Mina, do we have a book report today? Will, yes, I'm, yes. Sorry, I was just"
304,37,About listening when other people are talking.
304,38,"Oh. Um, we should listen, I just, I was, um, I was afraid that, that I, I forgot to do an assignment in"
304,39,"A Oh, gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. We can talk about that later. Alright, let's listen to, let's listen to Emily."
304,40,"Okay. Um, yeah, I was just saying, uh, for a norm. I lost my train of thought, but yeah, we should be respectful of people's, like, physical space, so"
304,41,"That's great. Yeah. I think that really is,"
304,42,Is this boring? Is this boring? Why are we doing this? Why are we doing this pretty
304,43,"Well? Cause this, this is so important to establish our classroom roles, norms, so that we're all on the same page and we can be, we can be respectful towards each other. It's very important to, yeah. To be careful and safe and respect each other well."
304,44,Hmm.
304,45,"Well, since it's the very first day of school, I wanted to do that early so that we're all,"
304,46,"Hey. All right. Well, uh, you are done with your."
305,0,Begin simulation.
305,1,Hello.
305,2,Hi.
305,3,"So we are gonna go over our classroom norms. Um, does anybody have anything that they remember from before break? That would be a classroom norm?"
305,4,"Hmm? <affirmative>. No cell phones, maybe."
305,5,No cell phones. That's a good one. And why would we not use cell phones?
305,6,Hmm. Sit up
305,7,"And I am sitting, sitting up. Need to pay attention. Which stop."
305,8,You're right. Mina. Are you paying attention? Paying attention is a good classroom.
305,9,"Oh yeah. Absolutely. I totally agree. Totally agree. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>,"
305,10,"You wanna pay attention and not use our phone so that we can respect our peers. Yeah. Um, does anybody else have a norm? They think is a good one for our"
305,11,"Classroom? Oh, no, my mom. Oh no, my mom is sending me a Yeah, text. I'm sorry. Sorry. Must have forgot something. Sorry. Sorry."
305,12,"Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Well, we typically try not to text in class, right? Because we wanna listen to our peers in conversation. Gotcha."
305,13,"Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Sure. Sorry, sorry about that. Oops. <laugh>."
305,14,"How about being kind to ourselves and others as a norm? Will, are you engaging with the class?"
305,15,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just kinda, you know, I stayed up a little too late last night. Uh, sorry. Whoops."
305,16,That's alright. But let's try and
305,17,"I should drink more coffee. Whoop. Sorry, Emily. Emily, are you gonna come into my birthday party? Oh, wait,"
305,18,"Jayla, we're having a conversation about classroom norms. Yes."
305,19,"Oh, I was just, I was just, um, checking in with Emily about a, about about after school. So, yeah, it's her, it's her birthday, so,"
305,20,"Well, we're in school right now, so we're talking about in school stuff."
305,21,Okay. Sorry.
305,22,That's all right.
305,23,"Oh, um,"
305,24,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Jayla.
305,25,"Yeah. I was gonna say like a good, a good norm would be maybe showing up on time and just being ready to like, work with whatever, you know, homework we had or reading we have to do and just being kind of ready to start the day."
305,26,Yeah. Being prepared and showing up on time so that we can be respectful of our own time and others' time. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Thank you. That was a good one. Does anybody else have one?
305,27,"Oh, oh, I was gonna say I saw Ironman over the weekend, which was amazing. I mean, I'd never seen it. I know. I'm like way behind on that. Um, he liked, that's"
305,28,"Iron Carlos,"
305,29,"Who's I'm pretty behind on, but, uh, you know, I'm catching up with his storyline. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, Bob Downey Jr. So amazing. Love it."
305,30,"Good stuff. You know, I think it's very cool that you wanna share that with us, but that's another good classroom norm, is to make sure that we focus on tasks and share things when it's appropriate to share things. So maybe we can set aside certain times when you can share things like that with the class, Emily."
305,31,"Yeah. I think, uh, another good norm would be maybe, uh, like being respectful of other people's space. Like, not, not running or throwing things or stuff like that."
305,32,"No. Yeah, that's a good one. You wanna be respectful of each other's things. That's absolutely right. Oh, and why would we do that? Because we don't want our"
305,33,"Thing. Did we have a book report you today? I thought we had a book report, didn't we? No. No. Well, what are you talking? Can't pay attention. Yeah. But, but I don't wanna like,"
305,34,"Hey, will,"
305,35,It's another assignment.
305,36,We would talk about that later. Right? And we're talking about classroom norms right now.
305,37,"Okay. I just thought there was a book report and I just kind of flipped. Sorry, I got a little nervous. <laugh>."
305,38,"That's okay. But what could you do if you have a, have a question like that? Who could you ask? This is,"
305,39,This is boring. Why are we doing this again?
305,40,"We're doing this so that we can make sure that we are all being efficient and productive in our classroom and respectful to others, right? We wanna have some norms so that our day goes smoothly, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Gotcha. I'm sorry that you think it's boring. Oh, sometimes boring things during the day"
305,41,"It happens. Okay. Um, hmm, hmm. And."
306,0,Begin simulation.
306,1,"Hello, pla. I hope you had a great time during summer. Did anyone do anything fun? If they wanna raise their hands,"
306,2,"Um, it's a lot of movies."
306,3,"Remember to raise our hands first and then we,"
306,4,Sorry. Oops.
306,5,What were you gonna say Jayla?
306,6,"Oh, I saw a movie. That's all"
306,7,"Very cool. So since we're back in the classroom, we kind of wanna go over,"
306,8,Sit up
306,9,Back to the classroom
306,10,"Sitting, which"
306,11,Means listening to the teacher
306,12,"Pay attention and paying attention. What,"
306,13,Let's look
306,14,First
306,15,"Classroom rules. So when we think about being respectful, what are some things that we wanna be respectful about? Raise your hand if you have any ideas."
306,16,"Um, um Oh, oh, no. Oh, I'm getting a text. I'm sorry. My mom is sending me a text. Emily,"
306,17,Being responsive during class and listening. Respectful thing to do.
306,18,"Okay. Yeah, sorry. Yeah. Oops."
306,19,That's okay. Can you think of anything else that we should be respectful to during the classroom?
306,20,"Um, other people's opinions, maybe."
306,21,"That's a great idea. We wanna make sure that when we're listening to others, that we want to be open-minded to what they have to say to make sure that we hear them and we're active listening. Will, could you tell me what active listening looks like?"
306,22,"Um, I think, uh, sorry, I'm just kinda, Ugh, it's getting a little sleepy. Sorry about that. It's just up really late last night. I'm sorry. Sorry about that. Sorry. Whew, sorry."
306,23,"Could you tell me a few things that active, active listening looks like, how that looks with our bodies and how we can"
306,24,Others come to the birthday party later?
306,25,"Hey Jayla,"
306,26,I'm gonna come later.
306,27,"Make sure that we're paying attention towards what the expectations,"
306,28,"I'm sorry. We were just talking about, uh, birthday party, that's all. I'm sorry about that."
306,29,"We talked about that outside of class because we wanna come back from our summer break and actively listen. So Will, were you gonna say something about what active listening looks like and then I'll go over to you after Jayla?"
306,30,Probably not falling asleep like I just did. So
306,31,"Definitely sometimes we're tired,"
306,32,"Not active listening,"
306,33,"But we wanna make sure that we're giving attention towards other people. Yes, Jayla?"
306,34,"Um, I was thinking showing up on time would be a really good norm. That's would be great work. Um, you know, whenever starting class. Yeah."
306,35,Yeah. That's great. That's how we can be successful. Does anyone else have any ideas?
306,36,"Oh, I just wanted to mention, I, you know, I finally got to see Carlos over the weekend"
306,37,Before you Go ahead.
306,38,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was gonna say, uh, you know, I really wanted to see Ironman for a long time and uh, finally got to it and, uh, what a treat."
306,39,That's awesome. What a
306,40,Great movie.
306,41,"Thinking about being, listening to the conversation. We also wanna stay on topic. So I would love to hear about after class cuz I've also seen that movie."
306,42,Are we ready? No problem.
306,43,"Yeah. So I kinda wanna go back to Jayla was saying about being prepared. Emily, do you have any other ideas about being prepared?"
306,44,"Oh, I was gonna say, um, like being respectful of people's, uh, space. So yeah. Not, you know, running around or, or taking people's things or, or, um, yeah, like stuff like that."
306,45,Exactly right. We wanna be safe because we wanna respect other people's spaces and we wanna make sure that everyone can learn in this environment safely. Does anyone else have any ideas of how we can be
306,46,Safe? Book report to today?
306,47,"Hey, will, let's pay attention Yes. To the classroom."
306,48,Okay. Yeah. This notebook report. Well
306,49,Because being respectful means
306,50,I was worried paying
306,51,"Attention to each other, but also paying attention to the teachers. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, we can engage."
306,52,Yes. Yes. I
306,53,Agree. Does anyone else have any ideas about being safe? Which is the great idea that Emily brought up.
306,54,This is boring. Why are we doing this?
306,55,"Jayla? We wanna make sure that we are being respectful for what we're learning in class because we just got off of summer break, we're kind of transitioning back into the classroom. Um, so I wanna make sure that we're all aware of the expectations as we go on with the school year. Do you have any questions about the expectations that we're talking about too? Oh,"
306,56,"No, no, no. I got it now. I got it Nick. For sure."
306,57,Ideas about how we can be respectful in the classroom.
307,0,"Okay. Um, it is time for your session to start. So begin simulation."
307,1,"Hi class. Welcome back to school. We're gonna start today's class by reviewing some of our classroom norms after your break. So, can anyone tell me a norm that we've talked about that we've established this year?"
307,2,"Ah, anyone no cell phones or texting rather in class?"
307,3,"Alright Carlos, thank you for that. So, one norm that we have is that we don't use our cell phones in class. And why don't we use our cell phones in class?"
307,4,"Um, oh, sit up. I'm sitting up."
307,5,Nina voices off.
307,6,"Okay, sorry."
307,7,"Why don't we use, Carlos? Had a great point. Why don't we use our cell phones in class?"
307,8,"Um, it's really disruptive, I think."
307,9,"Yeah. Great. Jayla. Yeah, it is really disruptive because if we're focusing on something else and we can't be focusing on what's going on, um, in class and we can't learn. Does anyone else have any other"
307,10,"Oh, no, my mom is sending me a, a text. Sorry. I wonder right,"
307,11,"Emily. Phones away. Oops,"
307,12,"Sorry. Okay, put it away. Sorry."
307,13,"Yep. Wonder Our first classroom norm is to put our phones away. Thank you, Carlos for that. Does anyone else have an idea of another"
307,14,Problem? Um hmm.
307,15,Could raise your hands.
307,16,"Oh, um,"
307,17,All right. How should we treat others?
307,18,Hmm.
307,19,"All right, will eyes forward please sit"
307,20,"Up. Sorry. Sorry, sorry. Woo, sorry. Spin. Spending little too much time."
307,21,How should we treat others? What did we review
307,22,"About that? Um, with"
307,23,Respect's
307,24,Respect.
307,25,"Great, thank you Mina. So what does respect look like to you all? How do we show respect to others?"
307,26,"Emily, um, the birthday party today. Oh, sorry."
307,27,Hi Kayla. How do you show respect to others?
307,28,"Um, I think, uh, you know, by listening to what they have to say and not talking over or, um, yeah. Right. You're listening respectfully and treating people kindly. Yeah."
307,29,"Great. So we can practice active listening that shows respect. So what does active listening look like when we're listening to someone? Oh, yes. Jayla, thank you for raising your hand."
307,30,"Yeah, yeah, <laugh>. Sorry about that. Um, so I was getting like focused, you know, like staying focused and looking forward and you know, having your work ready and just being ready to participate, you know, throughout class."
307,31,"Yep. That's a great norm that we're coming to class, ready to learn and ready to participate. So we could say that we're coming to class prepared. So does anyone else have any other ideas for norms?"
307,32,"Oh, I saw finally just saw Iron Man over the weekend. Wow. I can't believe it took me so long to see it. I don't know"
307,33,"What I've been doing. Alright, Carlos, let's talk about that during lunch or recess. Okay?"
307,34,"Okay. Okay. No, no problem. No problem. I'll be ready. Sounds"
307,35,Good. You brought up a great idea already. A great norm. Do you have any other ideas? Carlos?
307,36,"Um hmm. Maybe. Huh? I said the texting already, right? Um, oh,"
307,37,"You have one, Emily?"
307,38,"Yeah. Um, I was thinking, um, like being respectful of other people's space and like not, um, running or oh, like touching people's stuff or, you know, stuff like that."
307,39,"Yeah, no, I think that's really important. Respecting other people's space and not running. Why do we not run in the classroom? What is that? If, what if we do? That is the class."
307,40,"Oh, Mina, is there a book report to you today? Oh,"
307,41,"No. Well voices off. I,"
307,42,Okay. Sorry. Sorry. Yep.
307,43,Thank you. All right. Well Emily said that we're respectful of people's space and that we don't run. So why is that important?
307,44,"Um, oh,"
307,45,"Mina, do you have something? Yes. Yeah,"
307,46,"I was gonna say cause um, it just keeps everyone safe and, you know, sets boundaries, which is good."
307,47,"Great. Safety is so important in the classroom, so that's why we need to make sure"
307,48,This is boring. Why are we doing this?
307,49,"All right, Jayla, let's keep our eyes forward and let's focus into our discussion so that we can move on. But let's set our classroom norms first."
307,50,Okay? Okay. Sorry.
307,51,"Do you have any ideas, Jayla?"
307,52,"Um, no. I think I said focus already, so I'm not like show up on time. Maybe just, I think I said it already."
307,53,"Great. We talked about coming to class for reports. That means your materials, that means coming up."
307,54,"End simulation. All right, well thank you for your time."
308,0,<affirmative> begin simulation. How was your vacation?
308,1,Mine was really good. I'd love to hear how everyone else's was.
308,2,"Mine was good. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Yeah, it was good, but it was too short."
308,3,Too short? Yeah. What about you will? Yeah.
308,4,"Oh, it was good. I was at camp a lot. I was away most of the summer. Well, I went to see a lot of movies. There were tons of movies that came out this summer, so. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>."
308,5,"That's wonderful. I love movies. Emily, what did you do?"
308,6,"Not much. Not much. Are we gonna do, um, norms, because I have a really quick one."
308,7,Yes. We are going to do norms. So who can remind me of one thing that's really important to do when we enter the classroom?
308,8,"Uh, sit down."
308,9,"Sit down. Yes. And should we be running around being noisy and not starting our work right away? <laugh>, who can give me an example of another norm? Well,"
308,10,"You need to, um, sit up. Well sit up. It's ok. I'm sitting up. Shush."
308,11,It's okay. Will can take care of himself. Who can gimme an example of another norm?
308,12,"Oh, I got a text from my mom. Oh. Oh gosh."
308,13,I don't know what phone's having out as a part of one of our norms.
308,14,You're sending me a text. Wonder if I forgot something at home.
308,15,Emily. We can check that later. I'm sure everything's fine. Okay.
308,16,Okay. Sorry.
308,17,"No, it's okay. Jayla, do you have an example of a norm you'd like to share with us?"
308,18,"Uh,"
308,19,Looks like Will's having sleep.
308,20,Stay up straight up. Wait last night.
308,21,"So it sounds like when we come back from a vacation, we need to remember that we need to get sleep for school. That's how we can get our work done."
308,22,"Hey, are you gonna to jump, um, today? Are we gonna go? Yeah, it's gonna be my birthday party. You gonna come? I sent you an invitation. Are you coming?"
308,23,"Emily, Jay?"
308,24,I dunno. I'm
308,25,Not norms right now.
308,26,Okay. Sorry.
308,27,"It's okay. I just think we've forgotten how to act in the classroom. We've been out on vacation for so long, but I wanna respect you guys and I need you guys to respect me. That's how we learn together."
308,28,"Okay,"
308,29,"Carlos, do you have a norm that you'd like to share? What's something we always need to do in the classroom?"
308,30,"Um, well, I mean, yeah, I'm trying to think. But, um, you know, I saw the Iron Man movies, uh, this summer. They were so good. I loved the Iron Man. Um, movies. Well, um, have you seen any of those? They're so cool."
308,31,"I have, but remember that's not what we're talking about right now. We had our share time and it's awesome that you went to the movies, but we're talking about how to refocus and get ready to learn in school. Now, later on when we do writing, I'd love for you to write about the Ironman movies. Does that sound good?"
308,32,"Yeah. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Okay, teacher."
308,33,Thank you. Let's see. How should we
308,34,I have one.
308,35,"Oh, you do, Emily. Okay."
308,36,"Uhhuh. <affirmative>. I think that, um, we should, uh, the classroom norm should be respectful at other, other people's space and like, not running, not touching other people's things, that kind of stuff."
308,37,"Yes. That's a great one. That was gonna be my next one to share with you all. I think respect and treating each other with kindness is one of our most important norms. And that, what does that look like? That looks like not talking while other people are talking. Remember? Well, Mina and listening and being a good friend and treating our materials and our classmates with respect always. Thank you Emily."
308,38,"You know, uh,"
308,39,"Emily will, did you have something you wanted to share?"
308,40,"Nina, have you started the book?"
308,41,"Will and Nina, I'm speaking."
308,42,"Nice. Okay. Sorry, teacher. Thank"
308,43,"You. <laugh>. Whatever it is, it can wait until we're done with our class discussion."
308,44,"This is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?"
308,45,"Because we've been out of school for so long and clearly we need to remind ourselves how we act when we're in the classroom. I know it may seem a little boring, but it's important for us."
309,0,Begin simulation.
309,1,Hi class. How are you?
309,2,"Hi, teacher."
309,3,"All right. Today I wanna talk about a couple norms with you all that we wanna set, um, as we continue the school year. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So the first thing I wanted to talk about is being respectful. Who can tell me what it means to be respectful?"
309,4,"Um, that means that like you let other people talk and you don't interrupt."
309,5,"Okay. That's a good aspect of it. Thanks Carlos. Yeah. I would say being respectful, um, means caring about other people. Um, and being"
309,6,Sit up. You need to sit up.
309,7,"Nina, can I have your eyes and ears up?"
309,8,You need to pay attention.
309,9,"Thank you. Yes ma'am. Yeah. And so this goes right into being respectful. A part of being respectful is listening to other people who are talking. So sometimes it'll be the teacher and sometimes it'll be your classmates. So we need to make sure, um, as a part of that also we've raised our hand when we wanna talk. So for the rest of this conversation we can practice that too. Um, and going off of that, I thought another thing that would be cool for us to do is being, um, a"
309,10,"Text. Oh, I got a"
309,11,Text. Not a good time.
309,12,My mom sending. Not a
309,13,"Good time, Emily. So another thing we wanna do is make sure we're engaged in the lesson and what the teachers talk about or what your classmates are sharing. Um, and so part of that is just listening, um, to what's going on and thinking through things and redirecting your attention when you get distracted because we all get distracted. So we need to"
309,14,Redirect. I'm so tired.
309,15,I know. Will me too. I can
309,16,Last night.
309,17,"I know that happens to me too, but this is a good example of a distraction and we can remind ourselves in on the inside to redirect our attention. And we don't have to say it out loud. I like the nods. That's a good way to participate. Another thing we can do, another norm we can set is, Emily, are you"
309,18,Going to jump today after school?
309,19,Hey Jayla. Not a good time.
309,20,Hello? Are you gonna hang on. I'm birthday Emily.
309,21,Jayla not a good time. Let's focus on our classroom norms. Okay. Thank
309,22,"You. Okay, sorry."
309,23,Another thing we can do is be open-minded. Who can tell me what it means to be open-minded. I can help you all out. That kind
309,24,"Of just, uh, well, I know, I know. Teacher. Um, okay, go ahead. Like, um, open-minded means like, you, you like to hear other, other stuff, other ideas."
309,25,"Awesome. That's exactly what I would say. Yeah. It just means opening your mind to new ideas. Other people may think differently than you, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily wrong. So I think it's a great idea for us to be open minded to what other people have to say. Yes, Jayla."
309,26,Yeah. I think that should be one of our norms. Like be open-minded.
309,27,"I agree. Yeah, let's definitely have that one. No,"
309,28,"But um, I just saw the Ironman movies, um,"
309,29,"Carlos,"
309,30,"Those, I mean, that's really cool and they're kind of open-minded in those <laugh>. It's kinda funny. Yeah. But did anyone see the Ironman? Ah,"
309,31,"Okay. That's a good connection. We can talk about if your friends have seen the Ironman later, but I do like that you connected something in your everyday life to our classroom norms. That's very cool. Does anyone else have any norms that they would want to add to the list?"
309,32,"Yeah,"
309,33,Go ahead Emily.
309,34,"Um, I think, um, what of the norms should be that the, um, everyone in the classroom is respectable and respectful of people's space."
309,35,Yeah.
309,36,"Not running, not touching other people's things, except"
309,37,"That's awesome. Yeah. It's very important to be respectful because everyone comes to, but some people feel more sensitive to people being in their bubble or touching their stuff than other people. So it's always a good idea to give people their space. Um, and to ask if you need to borrow someone's ask."
309,38,"Are you, did you do the yet? Um, is it due today or not? Well, I might have missed something."
309,39,"Well, yeah,"
309,40,Yeah.
309,41,"Isaac, yours. Thank you."
309,42,Okay.
309,43,"All right. Any other norms that we wanna add to the list? I have one more I'd like to share. I think it's a good practice to be responsible too, which basically means on task,"
309,44,"This is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?"
309,45,"We're doing it so we know how to be good classmates to ourselves and to others. We wanna make sure that we're here at school ready to learn and we're respected. Um, and yeah."
309,46,"Okay. All right. And simulation. Uh, thank you for."
310,0,Begin simulation.
310,1,"Um, hello, uh, welcome back, uh, from"
310,2,Your Hi
310,3,"Ions. I hope you all had a great time. So here mm-hmm. We're gonna review the classroom norms that we've been practicing the school year. So it's a good refresher for you guys to, to continue following that. So, the first thing, um, I want you guys to continue."
310,4,"You need to sit up. Im sitting up. You need to pay attention. Well, I paying attention."
310,5,"Remember, when we are speaking, we're listening attentively to a teacher, and when we wanna speak, we must raise our hands. Okay. So that's the first thing. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, we wanna show respect. So being kind to others. Right now, you were not demonstrating tightness because you were speaking when I was speaking. And we must be sure to take turns and raise our hands. We wanna speak and especially wait for the,"
310,6,"Oh, I gotta, my mom is sending me a text. I wonder if I forgot something at home. Oh, oh, oh, no,"
310,7,"Emily. Um, is this an emergency?"
310,8,"Uh, no teacher. I'm sorry."
310,9,"Okay. If it's not an emergency, uh, remember to put our phones away. Um, right now we're learning and we're reestablishing that our classroom norms, so we must pay attention. Okay."
310,10,Stay up too late last night.
310,11,Will Okay. Listen to me. Will.
310,12,"Oh yeah. Sorry, teacher. I'm here."
310,13,"Yeah. Um, just try to, uh, put attention to me like, um, I, here I'm trying to"
310,14,"Explain, Hey Emily, are you gonna go to, um, jump today after school? I dunno, Jayla, but I'm definitely coming to your birthday party. Great"
310,15,"Class. Okay, cool."
310,16,"We're done. But we, uh, sorry."
310,17,"Yeah, I can all continue to talk if you guys are talking. So whenever you guys are finished we can continue. Are you guys done?"
310,18,We're ready.
310,19,"Okay. So again, classroom norms that we have been practicing throughout the school year. So the first thing is respect. Can anyone tell me what respect is? Yes. Jayla."
310,20,"Um, yeah, it means like, um, being nice and letting other people talk and don't interrupt and stuff. Like, uh,"
310,21,Yeah. Thank you Jayla. And did you guys show me that respect while I was speaking?
310,22,"Hmm. Well, um, I guess so. But you know what? I saw the, um, new Marvel movies this summer and they were so good. Did you guys see the Marvel movies? Emily, did you see it? Because it was so good. I saw it two times. Can"
310,23,"We discuss that during recess? I'll, I'll love to discuss Marvel with you cuz I also like it, but not right now. Okay."
310,24,"Oh, okay. Okay, teacher, sorry."
310,25,"Um, okay, so the first norm is, again, being respectful. The second norm, um, is communication. So you guys need to ask help when needed and use me as a resource. Like I'm the best resource. I know how, yes, Emily."
310,26,"Um, I just wanted to say like, with, um, the respect, it should like, include like, not running, not touching other people's things."
310,27,"Thank you. That's a great point. Uh, thank you for bringing that up. Um, yes. Uh, we, we have to be respectful with each other and with other things."
310,28,"Hi, Mina. Do we have a book report? Did you do it? It's June today or not? I don't, no,"
310,29,"We, Nina, we're we're talking right now and it's really okay. Respectful for you guys to have side conversations when I'm speaking again."
310,30,"Okay. A teacher,"
310,31,"You're not showing respect. Remember that respect is a big value in our school, and you must,"
310,32,"This is, this is so boring. Why are we doing this again?"
310,33,"Okay, Jayla, if, if you think this is boring, then you can speak to me right after your class. We are doing this"
310,34,Because
310,35,"This is an important, um, values and norms that you need to follow. Okay? Not only in school, but in life."
310,36,"All right? And simulation. Uh,"
311,0,"Start, begin simulation."
311,1,"Hi class. Um, today we're"
311,2,"Gonna, hi."
311,3,"Today we're going to be talking about our classroom norms. Um, the first thing we wanna make sure we're doing in our classroom is being kind. Do all of you know what that looks like in a classroom?"
311,4,"Um, yeah, I do. And I also think we should have a norm of no cell phones."
311,5,"Oh, that's a great idea, Carlos. Thank you. I agree. I think we should have no cell phones in our classroom. <laugh>. Um, does anyone else have any norms they want to add?"
311,6,"Sit up. I am sitting up. Mina, you need to pay to pay attention to the teacher. William. I'm paying attention. Mina. Shush. Stop. My gosh. Why keep me about it?"
311,7,"Um, could you guys, um, sorry, could you guys, um, let's get back to our conversation. Um, Mina and Will, do you have any classroom norms you wanna add to the list?"
311,8,"Oh my gosh. I'm, is"
311,9,Everything okay?
311,10,"Yeah, I just got a text from my mom."
311,11,"Aw. Um, was it something important?"
311,12,No ma'am. It's okay.
311,13,"Oh, okay. Great. Thank you. Um, so if that's the case, would you mind, um, putting your phone on silent for now and putting it away?"
311,14,Tired. I stayed up too late last night.
311,15,"Oh, well, I'm sorry. You're tired. I know. That's rough. Um, maybe we can take a quick break after we finish podcast."
311,16,"Okay. Next one. I, I'm like, sorry, sorry."
311,17,"Okay, thank you. Um, so the next storm is to be respectful of everyone in the classroom."
311,18,"Are you gonna jump today after school? Are you gonna go, Emily? I dunno. Um, I gotta check with my mom. I'm coming to your birthday party. Oh, cool you guys. Yeah, but I, let's go to jump today guys. What, please."
311,19,"Hi students. Um, would you guys mind just holding off on other conversations until we finish Assumption? Mm-hmm."
311,20,<affirmative>? Mm-hmm.
311,21,"<affirmative>? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Thank you. Yep. So that kind of brings us to the next norm. Um, listen and try to, um, be quiet when other people are speaking. Oh, thank you for raising your hand. Jayla, do you have a question?"
311,22,"Yes. Nope. I got one though. I got a norm that like, everybody needs to focus."
311,23,That's a great one. Thank you for that. We'll add that to the list.
311,24,"Speaking of focus, I saw the new Marvel movies, um, this summer. I saw 'em each like twice. Has anybody seen them? They're awesome. Anybody? Hello? Did you see new Marvel movies?"
311,25,"The Marvel movies are awesome. Um, but let's talk about the Marvel movies later. Let's stay on track here and finish. Um, any other norms that anyone wants to add? No. Um, yes. Emily,"
311,26,"Did we say, um, respect other people's space for one of our norms?"
311,27,"Oh, that is a really good one. Thank you Emily. Okay. When we're in this classroom, let's all remember to respect each other's space. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, so just imagine you have a bubble around you, and don't get close to anyone else's bubble either, especially if they don't want you to."
311,28,"Did you do the book report? Um, is that due today? Will me a little, yeah, but I think I forgot."
311,29,"Uh, will, um, we can talk about the book report later. It's okay if you haven't finished it. Let's finish."
311,30,Okay. Sorry.
311,31,"Oh, that's okay. Um, are there any last classroom norms anyone wants to add?"
311,32,"This is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?"
311,33,"Um, we're doing this so we can all feel, um, safe and happy in the classroom and so we can all learn. Um,"
311,34,"Okay,"
311,35,"We're almost done. Just wanna make sure we have everything, all of our norms on the list. Um, does anyone want to go over what we decided so far? Does anyone remember all of the norms?"
311,36,"Uh, some of 'em maybe."
311,37,"Oh, do you wanna talk up?"
311,38,Okay. End simulation. Thank you.
312,0,Begin simulation.
312,1,Hi everyone. How are you?
312,2,"Hi, teacher. Good,"
312,3,Good. Did everyone have a good vacation?
312,4,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. Yeah.
312,5,"Well, I'm excited to hear all about your Slater, but we need to remember our classroom norms. Does anyone remember?"
312,6,"Oh, um, I think we had one. Um, or I think we should have one that we don't have any cell phones in the classroom."
312,7,"Yeah, I agree. We need to have our cell phones away in our backpack. That's a good one, Carlos. So I have three major ones that we're gonna go over again. You guys ready?"
312,8,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.
312,9,Yeah. Okay. Number one. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Respect. So we need to respect our classroom space. That means we're not gonna
312,10,"Sit up. Oh,"
312,11,I'm sitting up.
312,12,Yeah.
312,13,"Do you remember what I just said? So we need focus, respect, which brings into our active listening skills. Does anyone remember what active listening is? No."
312,14,It's listen to teacher.
312,15,"Right? Good job, Emily. So active listening."
312,16,"Sending. So,"
312,17,"Oh, that's okay. We can figure it out later. So remember, active listening is when we listen to our peers send"
312,18,Text.
312,19,"Oh, Evelyn, remember we said we have to put our phones away. Can you put your phone away please?"
312,20,Oops. Okay. Yes.
312,21,Okay. So active listening is when we listen to our peers.
312,22,I stayed up too late last night sleeping.
312,23,You did well. Can you stay? And then we can talk about that later.
312,24,Okay. Okay.
312,25,"Hey. Okay. Yeah. I know vacation is hard to come back, but we're at school now, so that's good. Okay."
312,26,"Hey Emily, are you gonna go to jump after school today? Emily. Jayla."
312,27,Jayla.
312,28,"Um, yeah. Emily go the, I'm coming to your party"
312,29,Guys. We're Emily.
312,30,"Okay. Yeah. Sorry, teacher. Sounds"
312,31,Fun. That sounds fun. But we're in the school right now to focus on here. So remember we went over respect.
312,32,"I know,"
312,33,"I know, right? Vacation's fun. But we're back in school. So we have respect, active listening, and then we need to stay in our fit. Oh, yes. Jayla."
312,34,"Oh, I had a norm."
312,35,"Oh, what's your norm?"
312,36,"Um, everybody, um, needs to take turns talking. No interrupting."
312,37,"Yeah, that's a good idea. So that ties back into our class. Active listening. So everyone gets to talk and everyone gets to listen. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And then focus on what they're saying so they're able to respond when it's their turn. And then, so remember, I"
312,38,Thanks guys. I saw the Iron Man movies this somewhere. They were so good. Did anybody else see Iron Man? I saw them twice. Did you see it?
312,39,"I did not see it, but I'm so excited to hear about it later. Why don't we talk about it at recess when that's later on."
312,40,"Oh, okay. Okay, teacher."
312,41,"Great. So let's go back to our last one. The stay in our area seat and only use materials when instructed. Yes, Emily?"
312,42,"Um, I have one. Yeah. I think that, um,"
312,43,"Everybody should, um, like respect everybody else's space around them. Like what? Running and touching other people's stuff."
312,44,"That's a good, I I like your that norm. That's very good. Awesome. Thanks. Yeah. So does anyone have any other questions about norms or, I need to go over them again."
312,45,"Hey, Mina, did you, is our book report due today? I dunno if I, um, if I put it my backpack. I'm not sure. I dunno. Will did not book report. Did you do yours?"
312,46,"Will, do you have a question?"
312,47,"Oh, no, sorry. No."
312,48,"Okay. Well, if you ever have a question, remember raise your hand and then I will actively listen to your question and then respond."
312,49,"Oh, this is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?"
312,50,"Well, because we were on vacation, you guys might have forgotten how our classroom works."
312,51,"Yeah, okay."
312,52,"I know, I know. We'll do some more fun lessons later, but this is important."
312,53,Okay.
312,54,"Let's see. Are there any other norms that we can think of? So we have respect, active listening. Oh,"
312,55,And simulation.
313,0,"Weekend simulation. Hi, teacher."
313,1,Hi. How was everyone's vacation?
313,2,"Good. Good,"
313,3,Good. I'm glad you all had a good vacation. So today we're gonna be talking about our norms for our class. Do y'all remember us talking about norms before?
313,4,Oh
313,5,Yeah. I think we should have one where we don't have any cell phones in the classroom.
313,6,"Yeah, that's a good one. Carlos. I agree. They can be a big distraction, right?"
313,7,Mm-hmm.
313,8,<affirmative>. I agree. All right. So we had three norms that we talked about.
313,9,Sit
313,10,"Up straight,"
313,11,"Sit up,"
313,12,Listen to this.
313,13,I am
313,14,"Nina. Remember, our first norm actually is listen to the speaker. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, make sure you're listening to the person speak. If it's me, if it's your classmate, it's good to be respectful and listen to the speaker. So thank you. You're doing a great job. Thank you so much. So that was one. Number two is to keep your hands to yourself. Do we remember this one? Sorry. Of okay."
313,15,Sending you text. I forgot something.
313,16,Emily. Something.
313,17,"Oh,"
313,18,Forgot.
313,19,"Oh, okay. Um, can we look at that later after we talk about our norms? I can help you out with that. Okay. So our second one was to keep your hands to yourself. There's a lot of people in the classroom. Sometimes"
313,20,Stayed up too late last night. I'm
313,21,"Stayed up too late. Will, I'm so sorry. I'll give you a little bit of a break later. I, I know how that feels. And the last one, our third norm is others, how you want to be treated. So if you want someone to be kind to you and be nice to you, you should be kind and nice to others. Right? Do we remember that one?"
313,22,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah.
313,23,Good. That's all of the three norms. Does anyone have any questions or maybe some that they would like to add?
313,24,"Hey, Emily, are you gonna go to jump today after school?"
313,25,"I dunno. I, I'm not sure. Hey,"
313,26,Emily? After school?
313,27,Yeah.
313,28,"So I hope,"
313,29,Yeah. Oh yeah.
313,30,Does anyone else wanna share something fun that they're doing?
313,31,"Um, I got a norm. If you want one. Please"
313,32,Do. I would love to
313,33,"Hear your, think that, um, like everybody needs to focus."
313,34,"Focus. Yes. That's a good one. I will add that to our list. I love that one. Focusing is so important. And that goes with listening to the speaker. I think keeping focus on the speaker. That's great. Thank you, Jayla."
313,35,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.
313,36,Anyone else wanna
313,37,Share? You're welcome.
313,38,Thank you.
313,39,"Well, I have something to share. I saw, I just saw the Ironman movie this summer. I saw it twice. Did anybody else? It was so cool. Will, did you see it?"
313,40,"I didn't see it, no. Did anyone else see the Ironman movie? Nobody else? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. That's exciting. Carlos, was it good? You saw it twice. It must have been good, right?"
313,41,"Yeah, it was super great. I love the, um, I love the Marvel movies. Mm-hmm."
313,42,<affirmative> good. That's great. Anyone else wanna share? Yes. Emily?
313,43,"Everyone else's space? Like you don't run around. No. Touching other people's face,"
313,44,"That kinda stuff? Yes. That's a great one. That goes with number two. Keep your hands to yourself. Maybe we can add to that and say, keep your hands to yourself and off of other's space too. That's great. Emily, thank you so much."
313,45,"Mina. Mina. Is our book report due today? Will did you William? I'm not sure I, yeah, I mean, I didn't know."
313,46,"Well, I'm sorry. Can we focus back on the speaker? Did y'all have anything that you wanted to share?"
313,47,"No, ma'am."
313,48,Okay. Thank you so much. I think that's all of our norms. Y'all did a great job. Thank you for sharing. And thank you for coming up with some great norms.
313,49,"Uh, well, yeah. Uh, this is so boring. Why are we doing this again?"
313,50,"Well, you know, Jayla, we were just on vacation and we need to get back into the school mode, right? When you're on vacation, you're not thinking about school. We act. We wanna be focused on how we act in school, right?"
313,51,"Yeah, for sure. Teacher. Sure."
313,52,Thank you asking.
313,53,You're welcome and simulate.
314,0,Good morning.
314,1,Sorry about that. Hello?
314,2,"Hey, good morning everybody."
314,3,Hello. Hi.
314,4,"How is your vacation, Dale? How was your vacation?"
314,5,It was all right. It was all right.
314,6,"Well, good, good. That's good to hear. Well, today we're gonna be talking about classroom norms. Remember what our sit out are"
314,7,Norms are sitting.
314,8,Could you tell me pay norms?
314,9,"Oh, I trying to pay attention. Classroom norms are like, uh, rules. The rules."
314,10,"Okay. Rules. And will, is there anything else you'd like to add to Mina's definition?"
314,11,"Um, the other, I guess rules You follow? Mm-hmm."
314,12,"<affirmative>. Yeah. Rules you follow? So, does anyone remember any of our classroom norms?"
314,13,"Um, oh, go dear. I'm"
314,14,Sorry. Do you remember
314,15,Sending me a text? <laugh>. Wonder.
314,16,"I forgot. Phones away during school, please. Thank you."
314,17,Sorry. Sorry.
314,18,Did you remember anything about our norms?
314,19,"Um, well, uh, showing up on's a good one, baby."
314,20,That's a great one. How about listening? Can anyone tell me what listening looks like in the classroom?
314,21,"Um, uh, oh, dear. Sorry. Sorry,"
314,22,Bill.
314,23,"Sorry. Sorry about that. Hmm. Oh, tired. Sorry."
314,24,"All right. Okay. Getting up. Carl, how do we, how do we show listening? Will,"
314,25,"Sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I, uh, I stayed up too late <laugh> last night. Oh, I understand. Really? Awake. I'm sorry. Sorry about that."
314,26,"No problem. Do you remember anything about what, how we show listening? You"
314,27,Gonna come to my birthday?
314,28,"Everyone? Let's remember to be listening to Will as he gives his response. Will, do you have anything to share?"
314,29,"Um, uh, uh, I guess like, don't fall asleep in class."
314,30,"Don't fall asleep in class. That's a good first step. What else might, what might show a classmate? That"
314,31,Sounds good.
314,32,"What else might show a classmate that we're listening to them? Carlos, do you have any ideas?"
314,33,"Um, I think everybody, you know, being quiet, um, when they're supposed to and like letting one person, um, talk at once is good. I"
314,34,"Think that's great point. Thank you Carlos for that. Yeah. So one of the important things that we, how we show listening is by when someone else is talking, we are quiet. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> and way when we can hear what they have to say. And then when it's time for us to talk, we can share and everyone else will listen to us. Right? Right. That's a big one. How about participating?"
314,35,"Oh, oh, you know what? I just wanted to mention. I just saw Ironman over the weekend and like, it really lived up to the hype. I don't know why."
314,36,"Oh, that's awesome, Carlos. Thanks for sharing that. Let's continue our problem discussion norms right now and actually leading into a really great"
314,37,Marvel movies.
314,38,"How, what does it look like for us to stay on task?"
314,39,"Um,"
314,40,"Emily, do you have something to share? Go ahead."
314,41,"So all your stuff ready, like you're reading done and"
314,42,"Yeah. You're bringing up bringing, not being,"
314,43,"Um, devices and, and or running or touching"
314,44,"People's things. Good. That's good. So not doing something that we're not supposed to be doing during class, like being on our phones. That's right. And making sure that we're not making, doing anything disruptive, like running or touching other people during class. That brings us off task. And when we're in class, we're on, we're on task. Cuz we need to learn. That's great. How about collaboration? Does anyone tell me what collaboration"
314,45,"Looks, looks like in class today?"
314,46,"Hey, will."
314,47,"Yeah. I'm sorry. I was just asking. Um, um, thanks"
314,48,"For asking, but now is a time when we're all talking together, so let's stay focused on the whole class."
314,49,Okay.
314,50,"Can, can anyone tell me what collaboration looks like in the class? Nina, do you have an idea?"
314,51,"Well,"
314,52,"When we're working with our friend, with our other student, it's"
314,53,Boring. Why are we
314,54,"Doing this? Oh, why are we doing this? That's a great question. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Cause when we e established our classroom norms, we are establishing the way that we respect each other and work well together. That's really important for all of us to feel comfortable, huh?"
314,55,"Yeah, yeah. No, no, no. I hear you. Makes"
314,56,"Sense. Yeah. We all wanna be comfortable in classrooms. So when you're working with someone else, how do you want them to act around you?"
314,57,"Um hmm. Lemme think. Uh, well I guess like I would Alright, end simulation. Uh,"
315,0,So we will begin simulation.
315,1,Good morning everyone.
315,2,Hi there.
315,3,How's everyone doing today?
315,4,Hey Kate. How are you?
315,5,"I'm doing well. Cool. Um, so let's get started and review some norms. I know many of you are excited. Um, we just came from back for vacation. Um, yeah. So let's talk about respect and listening, uh, to each other and listening to me. Um mm-hmm. <affirmative>, what does that mean to each of you?"
315,6,"Snap. I'm sitting up. What do not paying attention. Oh, I'm sorry. Paying a, I'm sorry. Sorry. All right."
315,7,"Nina, do you have, um, something you wanna say? Oh,"
315,8,"No, I was just trying to get,"
315,9,"Oh, okay. That's fine. What about you, Emily?"
315,10,"Oh, oh, no, I'm sorry. Oh, my mom is sending me a text. Oh, I wonder if I forgot something in home."
315,11,"Oh, okay. I hope everything's okay."
315,12,"Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Everything's good. Everything's good. Sorry about that."
315,13,"Perfect. What about, um, you Jayla, what does respect mean to you?"
315,14,"Um, um, I think means, uh, paying attention, uh, when someone's talking maybe?"
315,15,"Yeah. Well, are you feeling a little tired?"
315,16,"Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, sorry. I stayed up too late last night. I was watching, it was on YouTube Regional. Sorry. Right honor."
315,17,"Okay. Let's get, let's refocus."
315,18,Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.
315,19,"No, that's fine. Um, I get that, um, everyone's excited to see each other again. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But, um, let's also talk about, um, hand raising. Cuz many of you, like, it's been a while since it's been in the classroom, but just remember if you have an idea you wanna share to raise your hand and then, you know, Jayla, you have a question. Oh,"
315,20,"Yeah. I was just thinking for a, um, a good norm would be, uh, she got on time and, uh, yeah. Yeah. Just kind of being ready to go, you know, at the beginning of class, stuff like that."
315,21,Yeah. That's a good norm. Hmm. Have another norm.
315,22,"Um, oh, oh, I just wanted to say I saw, finally saw Iron Man, uh, this weekend. I knew him like 10 years late, but it was so awesome. So awesome. Awesome."
315,23,Okay.
315,24,"Really cool. I love those Marvel movies, so I'm just kinda getting hooked as you can say. Yeah. <laugh>. So,"
315,25,Okay. Does anyone have another norm they wanna address?
315,26,"Um,"
315,27,"Yeah, Emily."
315,28,"Yeah. Um, I think it's good to be respectful, uh, people's space and, uh, you know, maybe not to run or touch other people's things. You know, just kinda give people, um, space."
315,29,"Yeah. No, that's excellent, excellent point. Yeah. It's important that we're mindful of each other's space and we don't intrude on another person's face."
315,30,"Oh, yeah. Oh, oh. Um, Mina, did we have anything due today? No, please. Came back from vacation."
315,31,"Will I, Mina?"
315,32,"Oh, I'm sorry. I was just worried about I, for some reason I thought something was due today, but, but it's the first day back from vacation, right? Yeah's fine."
315,33,"Yes. But it's important. It's important and we're respectful. Okay. So you can talk about, about that during break"
315,34,Or Gotcha.
315,35,Okay.
315,36,"This is, um, boring. Well, why are we doing this again?"
315,37,"Well, Jayla um, we're covering this because it's been a while since we've been in the classroom and it's important to watch on these topics once again."
315,38,Okay. Okay. Just checking. Sorry. That's
315,39,Fine.
315,40,Hmm.
315,41,"Uh, that the norms. Um, does anyone have you wanna add?"
315,42,"Um hmm. Lemme think. Um, all right, well that, that's it. Uh, thank."
316,0,Begin simulation. Hi teacher.
316,1,Hi.
316,2,How was your vacation?
316,3,It was great. How was y'all's?
316,4,Good.
316,5,"Good,"
316,6,"Good, good."
316,7,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.
316,8,"Awesome. Well, we're gonna go over some classroom norms today for the rest of the year. Does that sound like a plan?"
316,9,"Oh yeah. I mean, and um, I think we should have one of, uh, no cell phones."
316,10,"That's a great one, Carlos. Yeah, we can definitely add that. Do y'all have any other suggestions?"
316,11,"Yeah,"
316,12,You need to sit up straight. Sit up straight. I am sitting up straight.
316,13,Sh
316,14,"You need to pay attention. You need to pay attention. Will, are you listening"
316,15,To me?
316,16,I am listening. Nina. Quiet.
316,17,"Hey Will. Nina, let's focus on the task we have at hand, okay?"
316,18,Okay. Teacher.
316,19,"Yeah. So some other, um, classroom norms that I was thinking besides Carlos mentioning no cell phones. What about respecting others, whether they're space or their opinions? Does that sound like a good one to add?"
316,20,Sending text. Oops.
316,21,"What she wants got something at her, I think."
316,22,"Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Oh,"
316,23,She's texting
316,24,Me again.
316,25,My mom is sending me a
316,26,Text.
316,27,"Oh no. Well, Emily, let's phone away. Okay. And let's, it's all good. What about following directions the first time"
316,28,"I stayed up too late last night, I'm sleeping."
316,29,"Oh, no. Well, well let's keep on focus on the task at hand. Okay? Okay."
316,30,And
316,31,Then maybe we can have a brain break later.
316,32,"Hey Emily, are you gonna go to jump today?"
316,33,"Um, I dunno, but I definitely"
316,34,Coming to your birthday
316,35,Party.
316,36,"Okay, good. Well, I'll tell my mom you're gonna come, but let's go to jump, um, if we can. Yeah. Hey, Kayla, up there. Come meet at the flag pole."
316,37,Let's talk about classroom norms. Okay. We'll have another option where we can talk to Emily later.
316,38,Okay.
316,39,<laugh>. And then why don't we only talk when we're allowed? Does that sound like a great plan?
316,40,"Mm-hmm. <affirmative>,"
316,41,"We can keep on, keep focused. Yeah. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And then do y'all have any others that y'all like, that y'all would like to add to our classroom rules and norms?"
316,42,"Um,"
316,43,"Yeah. Jayla,"
316,44,Did we say everybody's got a focus? Did we say focus?
316,45,"Yeah, that, that's a great one. We can always get focused on the task at hand so we get through all the learning activities that we're gonna do. That's a great one. Does anybody else have one that they'd like to add? Yeah, Emily."
316,46,"Um, I think should people's not touching other people's things,"
316,47,"That kinda stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Definitely. Those are great ones. Do y'all have any others? No. Okay. Well I have a few more. So why don't we always be prepared for class? Okay. So if we have a homework assignment that we're gonna do, we need to do it before we come to class so you can actively participate."
316,48,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.
316,49,"Yeah. That's a great one. And then I guess a last one that we have, um, besides being kind to your neighbor and respecting their space and their opinions is just having fun. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>."
316,50,Oh yeah. Can I have?
316,51,"Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Well thank y'all so much for helping"
316,52,"Me, Mina. Oh, do you, um, do we have a book report due today? Is it due today or not? I dunno. Will, we're supposed to be listening now."
316,53,"Hey, will, I"
316,54,Forgot my book report? Yeah. Hey.
316,55,"Hey, will, we're focusing on our classroom norms right now. Okay. If you have a question, got your report, come talk to me later. Okay."
316,56,"No, I got a norm. Um, everybody has to come prepare."
316,57,"Yeah, that's a great one. Okay, well thank y'all so much. If y'all don't have any more, um, suggestions,"
316,58,This is boring. Why are we doing this again?
316,59,"Because it's important to have classroom rules and norms cuz if we don't, then the classroom won't function properly. So that's why we're doing"
316,60,That's
316,61,"Good. Yeah. But we're, but if teacher, if nobody else has any other suggestions, then thank you so much for participating, creating your classroom room norms with me."
316,62,Okay. All right.
317,0,Begin simulation.
317,1,All right. Hi everyone. Welcome back from vacation. I am sure you were very
317,2,Hi.
317,3,To be back. Yes. Mm-hmm.
317,4,<affirmative>. Mm-hmm.
317,5,"<affirmative>. All right. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, we are going over classroom norms, so I need your eyes and ears and heart over here on me, please. That's one of our be respectful norms, if you remember. That's how we show that we're actively listening and engaged. Can someone remind me if I'm actively listening and I'm engaged, should I be talking to my neighbor?"
317,6,"Um, no, but I wanted to suggest a norm of no cell phones."
317,7,"No cell phones. That would be a good one, Carlos, because you remembered that. To be respectful, we need to be engaged and on our cell phone. That's not me being engaged, is it?"
317,8,You need to sit up. I'm sitting up.
317,9,"Nina, do you have another you"
317,10,To pay attention?
317,11,I'm up here.
317,12,Hi.
317,13,"Did you have a wanted, um, remind our friends about?"
317,14,No. No. Sorry.
317,15,"No. Okay. Um, do you reremember, maybe you can tell me what does being prepared in the classroom look like?"
317,16,"Uh, well, that's just when you have your planner, your homework, all your stuff that you were supposed to bring and backpack and you bring it to school."
317,17,Yeah. So being prepared. Looks like having what? I need my pencil. I might come to the small group. People
317,18,With pencil.
317,19,I got a text.
317,20,My mom sending me a text.
317,21,"Emily,"
317,22,I forgot something at home.
317,23,"Emily, what's going on?"
317,24,I got a text from my mom.
317,25,You got a text from your mom? I think it can wait. Do you think it can wait?
317,26,Yes. Sorry.
317,27,"Yeah, that's, but you remembered like, yeah, I have this text. It seems really important, but I know that being respectful looks like waiting, so I'm gonna wait until"
317,28,I'm tired. I stayed up too late last night.
317,29,"All right. Another one of our norms is to be safe. Will, do you think that you could help me out and remind me, what does being safe look like in the classroom?"
317,30,"Being safe. Uh, sitting in your chair? Yeah."
317,31,"Safe would be sitting in your chair as opposed to maybe like standing on your chair. That would probably not be safe. Jayla, do you have another way you can remind me? Leslie?"
317,32,"Emily, are you going to jump tomorrow with me? Um, we're gonna meet there after school. Um, I'm not sure I can ask my mom. Well, lemme know if you're gonna Yeah, yeah,"
317,33,Yeah. I wanted to ask if you had a way that you could remind us how we can be safe in the classroom.
317,34,"Um, everybody stay focused."
317,35,"Yep. Staying focused. You know, it would be a great time if I had something I really, really, really wanted to ask. I might write it down so that I can remember. Oh, I'm being focused. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But I wanna remind myself to ask someone this thing after we're done. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, right? Mm-hmm."
317,36,"<affirmative>. Yeah. Hmm. Uh,"
317,37,"So I've hit on being prepared, being safe. Being respectful. Does anyone else raise your hand if you have another norm that I've maybe forgotten that you would think would be a great norm to add to our list?"
317,38,"Guys, I saw the, um, Ironman movies, um, yesterday. Ah, that was so cool. They're so good. Did anybody else see the Ironman movies? I love Marvel comics. Hmm."
317,39,"Carlos, I think that you, you're hitting on some kind of idea, Carlos. I think that you're trying to say that maybe if you have something you want to share that we're talking about, everyone needs to listen so that they can understand what you're trying to say. Right?"
317,40,"Um, maybe I was talking about the Marvel movies, actually."
317,41,"Yeah, I know. And I would really love to hear that later. But what I noticed was that if you really wanted to share somebody, you really want someone else to hear you. Right. So it's really important as one of our norms. Emily, I'll get you in a second. It's really important as one of our norms to listen to what the other person's saying, right. With your eyes and your ears and your heart. Yes, Emily. Gosh."
317,42,"To be respectful of people's space, like you're running, touching other people's stuff,"
317,43,"That's an awesome norm, Emily. Being safe and being respectful is, you know, keeping your your hands to yourself. Yes. Remember friends, remember being respectful is listening to the person who's talking. And right now, that's me. All right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative> my turn. Thank you. So Emily was saying to be safe with our hands and with our stuff and with our space. Maybe not running in the classroom, maybe not shuffling."
317,44,"Oh, this is, this is so boring. Why are we doing this again?"
317,45,"We're doing this because you're right. Sometimes it is really boring and we gotta get through some boring stuff before we get to fun stuff. If you've ever ridden on a rollercoaster, they tell you like keep your hands and feet and you really don't wanna hear that. Maybe that's the boring part of the ride. But in order to have fun, we need to set some norms. Right? Well, that's why we're doing this."
317,46,And simulation.
318,0,Begin simulation.
318,1,Hey everybody. How's it going today?
318,2,"Good, good."
318,3,How was your break? Did you have a nice time off?
318,4,Yeah. Pretty good. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Good. Good. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.
318,5,"That's great to hear. Yeah, I had a nice time away too. It was very relaxing."
318,6,Good.
318,7,"So we're back in class and we've had some time away from each other. So, um, before we get started with our day, I just wanna spend a few minutes talking about, um, you know, some of the things that we've been working on the first part of this year, and just making sure we're following rules for safety and courtesy."
318,8,"Oh, we should definitely have a, a rule that we don't have any cell phones."
318,9,"No cell phones. I think that's a great rule. That's a very good rule. Thanks Carlos. Anyone else? Um, if you can raise your hand and tell me"
318,10,"Another rule. Sit up straight. Pay attention. I'm Nina. Leave me alone. No, but you're not listening. I'm listening. Nina, leave me"
318,11,"Alone. Nina. Nina, can I see your eyes up here? Nina? Hey, how are you? Can you come up with a, can you come up with a rule that we should all try to follow?"
318,12,We should all pay attention.
318,13,"Yeah, I think that is a great rule. Let's pay attention. And, um, related to that, um, will, can you think of any another I"
318,14,Got a text. Carlos. I got a text from
318,15,"My Oh, Emily. Emily. I'd love to hear from Will, can you pause for a moment?"
318,16,My mom sent me a text. Maybe I forgot something at home.
318,17,"Well, I think Carlos already shared a great rule, which was no cell phones in class. But also I want to hear from Will. So let's, let's all listen to Will"
318,18,They stayed up too late last night? I'm
318,19,"Tired. Oh, I was up late too. Will, but we all have to be ready for school and be ready to learn. All right. Well, I would love to share a rule that I have, and that is one around safety. So as we're moving around the classroom, that means no running or no pushing. Does that sound like a good rule? We can all follow"
318,20,"Up. I'm like, are you gonna come to jump tomorrow? Um,"
318,21,Jayla? Yeah. Did you hear what I was I did you hear? I was just talking. Did you hear the rule that I shared?
318,22,"Uh, no. I'm sorry."
318,23,"No. Well, I'll say it once more, but I want you to listen carefully. Okay?"
318,24,Okay.
318,25,"So as we're moving around the room, one thing that's really important is to be safe. So no pushing or running around the room."
318,26,Mm-hmm.
318,27,"<affirmative>. Okay. What's another rule that is really good for us to consider? What about if you need to leave for any reason, what would you think would be good? Yeah, Jayla."
318,28,"Um, I was just gonna say, um, well, you should raise your hand before you leave the classroom, but I was just gonna say, I think normal would be for like everybody to focus."
318,29,"Yeah. Excellent. Um, I love raising your hand."
318,30,"I just saw the Iron Man movie. It was so, I love good, I love Marvel comics and movies."
318,31,"I love them too, Carlos. But let's, let's stay on this for a few more minutes. Okay. Can I, can I have your help on that?"
318,32,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yes.
318,33,"So raising your hand is very good. Now, if you need to leave the room, maybe if you need to go to the bathroom or get some water, definitely. You have to let me know before you leave, right?"
318,34,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>
318,35,Good?
318,36,"Yeah. Um, yeah."
318,37,"So let's, let's just review quickly. We have a, a couple of good rules. Carlos, I think you told us no cell phones, correct?"
318,38,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.
318,39,"Okay. And Jayla, you said raise your hand to get attention, right?"
318,40,Nina? Mina. Do we have a book report? Do
318,41,"Will, will,"
318,42,Yeah. Let's clarify
318,43,Our book report later. Okay?
318,44,Okay.
318,45,"All right. And if you have a question, you can ask me. Okay?"
318,46,"Oh, that's okay. Okay."
318,47,"Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you. All right, so we talked about safety, we talked about, um, raising our hands. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And one more really important rule is just the level of voice that we use throughout the day. When we're indoors, we have to use a quieter voice. And when we're outdoor,"
318,48,"Oh, this is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?"
318,49,"Well, Jayla, it's, I know it might not be super exciting, but guess what? These rules are really helpful for all of us so that we can work together. Cause there's a lot of people, there's a lot of us in this classroom, so we have to work together. Right?"
318,50,"Hey, but I know. Okay. It's best way."
318,51,"Thank you. I really appreciate it. So the last thing I was saying is we all have to use the re Oh,"
318,52,Okay.
319,0,Begin simulation.
319,1,Good morning everyone.
319,2,Hi teacher. Hi.
319,3,How was everyone's Summer break.
319,4,Good.
319,5,How was yours?
319,6,"Oh, it was good. Thank you for asking. How was anyone else's?"
319,7,Mine was good. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah.
319,8,"Good. Well it sounds like most of y'all had a really good summer break. Um, since it is the first day back, I did wanna go over classroom norms with everyone. So does anybody remember any classroom norms that have been used previously?"
319,9,Yeah.
319,10,"Um, uh, no cell phones."
319,11,"Yeah, that's a great one. Carlos. Anyone else?"
319,12,Sit up. Sit up.
319,13,"I'm sitting up. Be quiet. Mina. No, you're not paying attention right now."
319,14,"Oh, okay. What about you? Will, do you remember any classroom norms?"
319,15,"Um,"
319,16,No interrupting everybody.
319,17,"Yeah, that's a great one. Yeah. Thank you for sharing. Will. And Emily, I haven't heard from you yet this morning. Do you remember any classroom norms?"
319,18,My
319,19,"Mom right now, I gotta"
319,20,Look at this. My mom's sending me a text.
319,21,"Oh, actually one of the norms that Carlos reminded us of is that you're not supposed to use your cell phones in class, so it's okay for this time. I know we're getting back in the same norms, but just put it away for now, please. Okay. Are there any other norms that anyone remembers?"
319,22,<laugh>.
319,23,Okay. Well let's talk about respect
319,24,Too Late last night. I'm tired.
319,25,"Oh, you're tired. I'm so sorry to hear about that. Do you wanna stand up and stretch and get your blood moving a bit?"
319,26,"Oh, oh, what?"
319,27,That's okay. It's her teacher.
319,28,Sure. Yeah. Let's just talk about what respect looks like. So what does active listening look like? Does anybody know what that term means?
319,29,Are you gonna go to jump tomorrow? Cause I'm going
319,30,"My,"
319,31,"Okay, cool. We gotta meet at the flag then if we wanna get there off time."
319,32,"Hey, Jayla, Jayla, Emily. Let's, let's get back in. Let's bring it back together a little bit. Do you remember what active listening looks like? Sure. What does it look like?"
319,33,"Uh, like this."
319,34,"Yeah, it does. Exactly. So you're all sitting up really straight. You're giving me eye contact. You're nodding. So that's really helpful for me cause it helps me know that you all are listening to me and I don't need to repeat anything. Great. Um, what about respecting others? What, what might we do to respect others when we're in school?"
319,35,"Guys, I saw the new, um, the Iron Man movie up in the summer. It was so good. Did y'all see it? I love Marvel movies. That's"
319,36,Really cool. Have you seen all of the
319,37,"Marvel movies? Yes. Uh, quite a few. Yeah? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, have you quite seen them? That's cool. Emily, have you seen them? Yeah. They are so good. Ah, I could tell you the whole, whole movie actually right now. Maybe I will. So, Carlos, what happens in"
319,38,"This entire movie? Maybe you could share the plot to the Marvel movies on a different day or maybe during recess, but that kind of brings me to our point."
319,39,Okay. Teacher
319,40,"<laugh>. Thank you. Yeah. So respecting others means that we're not interrupting each other while we're speaking. It means that we are practicing active listening and looking at people when they're talking. So that's what most of you are doing. So great job with that. Um, and also respecting others can mean respecting their time as well. So when we're getting people distracted and we're getting people off task, sometimes that's kind of, Hey,"
319,41,"Mina, do we have a book report due today? Mina, can you hear me? Mina? You"
319,42,Will hear
319,43,"The question. You answer me, please. Oh, no, I'm sorry. Go ahead. No,"
319,44,"No, that's okay. You're bringing up, uh, the due date of a book report. And one big thing that we can have for our norms is the expectation that people are gonna be turning things in on time. So you asking when the book report is due, um, is really helpful because someone else might not know when it's due. And that is another norm, is that we are going to, you know, hold each other accountable and hold ourselves accountable. And"
319,45,"Is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?"
319,46,We are doing this because it's important that we're setting norms so that we are respecting each other while we're in school.
319,47,"Oh yeah, that's right. Yeah. Okay."
319,48,Yeah. Don't you feel like a classroom is a little bit better when everyone respects each other?
319,49,Mm-hmm.
319,50,<affirmative>? Yeah. Yeah.
319,51,Teacher <laugh>. Okay.
320,0,"Start, begin simulation."
320,1,"All right. Hi guys. Uh, today I'm going to go over our classrooms. Hi. Okay. Hi."
320,2,Okay.
320,3,"All right. So our first classroom rule is raise your hand if you need something. Um, if you need to feel, if you need water or you, if you need to go to bathroom, or if you have any questions, it's important. Um, I want you guys to raise your hand because we don't want, um, many people to talk."
320,4,"Oh, I have a norm. I, um, I think we should have no cell phones in the clock."
320,5,"Yeah, that's also very true. Thank you. But, um, Carlos, could you, can you raise your hand before you say something?"
320,6,"Mm-hmm. <affirmative> will sit up. Will, um, I'm sitting up. Nina, you need to pay attention."
320,7,"Yeah. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, can you guys pay attention? Thank you. All right. And our second and is going to be, be an active listener. So when someone is talking, um, we need to look at that person and we need to listen to that person. Um, because that's, that's a respectful."
320,8,"I know. I got a text from my mom. Oh, forgotten."
320,9,"We just talked about being an active listener, right? Is that"
320,10,I got a text
320,11,To interrupt when I'm talking. No.
320,12,Yeah.
320,13,"So raise your hand if you need something or if you have any, any questions or, um, yeah. Third,"
320,14,"Straight up, too late last night."
320,15,"Be kind to each other. Okay. How can we be kind to each other? You guys here? Will, are you, what's wrong? Are you okay? Tired?"
320,16,"I'm just so tired. Too late last night. Emily, are you gonna come to my birthday party? Um, I think I'm coming. Jayla, I'm gonna ask my mom"
320,17,And
320,18,Emily cause my mom needs to Kayla. Hmm. Hmm.
320,19,You have something to say?
320,20,"No, we just,"
320,21,"Our classroom, Lord. What, what's the second one? I an active listener, right?"
320,22,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. Yeah.
320,23,"So I was talking so you shouldn't be talking when I'm talking, right?"
320,24,"Um, yeah, but I got"
320,25,One. All right.
320,26,Yeah. Everyone needs to focus. That should be one of our norms. Mm-hmm.
320,27,"<affirmative>, right? Everyone needs to be focus."
320,28,Mm-hmm. <affirmative> great. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah.
320,29,"And do you guys have any ideas? We can, um, we can add more to our classroom norms."
320,30,"Oh, I just, um, I saw the Ironman movie this summer. It was so good. I love Marvel movies. I'm gonna see it again. I've seen it twice already."
320,31,"Okay, Carlos. But I can,"
320,32,"Um,"
320,33,"Off the topic, can we talk about our classroom norms?"
320,34,"Oh, okay."
320,35,"Okay. So we have, so far, we have raised your hand. If you need something, be an active listener and be kind to each other."
320,36,Yeah. What about focus? Said focus.
320,37,"Oh, yeah. And then pay attention. Be focused during class. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Great. Um, how can we be kind to each other? Can you guys gimme examples?"
320,38,"Um, like, um, don't interrupt other people when they're talking."
320,39,"Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. That was our second rule, right? Um,"
320,40,A book report due today. Nina. Hey.
320,41,"Um,"
320,42,I think I might have missed it.
320,43,"Will, can you record?"
320,44,"Thank you. Okay. Sorry, teacher."
320,45,So that was our classroom. No. Does anyone have questions?
320,46,"Um, did we say that, um, being kind is like, um, keeping in your own space, in your own area, on your desk, keeping your place, um, clean."
320,47,"Um, that can be one. Um, be, being kind could be like, just being respectful."
320,48,"This is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?"
320,49,"Because it's important to, um, set, have classroom expectations."
320,50,"Oh, right, right, right. Okay. Teacher, right?"
320,51,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So being kind means being respectful of other people's opinions and their ideas and just being nice to them.
320,52,Okay. End simulation.
321,0,Start weekend simulation.
321,1,Hi everyone.
321,2,Hi teacher.
321,3,How are you doing today?
321,4,"Good, good."
321,5,How was your break? Did anyone do anything fun?
321,6,"Um, yeah, went to the pool a lot. It was good."
321,7,"Yeah, that sounds like a lot of fun. Did anyone else do a fun?"
321,8,"What are we doing today, teacher? What"
321,9,"Are we doing today? Well, we're gonna review some of our classroom rules and norms since we just came"
321,10,"Back from Oh, I have one. Um, no cell phones? No cell phones. No cell"
321,11,Phones. That's a good one. Carlos. Thank you for saying that. Does anyone else have any ideas of what our classroom norms are and our roles? Does anyone remember any? No. I see Mina shaking her head. I know one. What am I doing right now?
321,12,"No,"
321,13,I'm sitting up. You need to pay attention. I am paying attention. Stop.
321,14,"Stop the side conversation. We're gonna be talking about our <inaudible>. So one of the things we wanna have listening ears, we wanna be paying attention to the person who's talking. So I like how you listened to what I said and turned back to the conversation. Thank you for doing that."
321,15,My
321,16,Mom is sending me a text. I this.
321,17,"Yeah. Emily, do you remember what Carlos said? He said one of the rules is no cell phone. So I'd appreciate if you could look at that later. Okay? Okay. Thank you. What other rules do we have? I just said listening ears."
321,18,Carlos said
321,19,I stayed up too late last night.
321,20,"You did? Yeah. Well, one of the things we can also do is to not have side conversations. And if you need to take a break, we can have a space in our room where you can go. And if you need to close your eyes for a second, do you think that would be helpful too? That's one of a good,"
321,21,"Yeah, I'm okay. I'm awake. Sorry."
321,22,"Okay. <laugh>, what else do we have? We have Be respectful. What does that mean? What does that look like?"
321,23,"Hey. Hey, Emily, are you coming to my birthday party this weekend,"
321,24,Emily? I think so.
321,25,"No side conversations, please."
321,26,"Oh, okay. Sorry teacher."
321,27,"That's okay. Thank you for listening. What else do we have? We can be respectful. We can have calm bodies. Yes. Jayla, thank you for raising your hand. That's one of our norms."
321,28,"Yeah, I got one. Um, like, um, everybody needs to focus."
321,29,Everybody needs to focus. That's a good one. Yeah. To focus on your work. Like if we're doing an assignment or for reading. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. That's a good one. I like.
321,30,Thanks.
321,31,"Does anyone else have any ideas, Carlos or No? No. I see a"
321,32,"Lot of, well, I was just gonna, um, say that I saw all the Iron Man movies this summer. Did anybody see 'em? Were so Yeah."
321,33,Talk about that later. Remember one of welcome side conversations. So we wanna be focusing on what we're doing here.
321,34,Okay.
321,35,"Thank you. So there's something else I said. Let's see. Raise our hands. Be respectful. Listening ears. Yes. Emily, you have one."
321,36,"Everybody should respect space. Like, no running around or catching other people's things."
321,37,"Yeah, that's a good one. Keeping each other's space. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And if you want to play with someone or you want to do something with someone, you can always ask and you ask respectfully. That way, you know, if someone really wants to play with you or do something with you, that's part of being respectful. Will, do you have any"
321,38,"Ideas? Do we have that, um, book group work due today?"
321,39,"Will, I"
321,40,Dunno. I don't think so.
321,41,"Conversations, please. Okay. Let's see. Can we come up with"
321,42,One
321,43,"More rule? Can you think, think about it."
321,44,"Um,"
321,45,"I'll give you a hint. One is if something goes bad, what can you do? You can talk about things with people, right? If your feelings are hurt,"
321,46,"Or, oh, this is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?"
321,47,"I know Jayla, but we have to go over our rules and our norms. If you need a second, remember we can go to our space in the classroom where you can have a second to yourself. That's one of our, oh,"
321,48,Right. Oh yeah. Yeah. Okay. Cool.
321,49,Does anyone else have anything?
321,50,Mm-hmm.
321,51,"No, that's it. Okay. Let's see what else? Listening ears, raising hands,"
321,52,And simulation.
322,0,"Start, begin simulation. Hi teacher."
322,1,"Hi everybody. Um, welcome back to choir."
322,2,"Hi, thanks"
322,3,"<laugh>. Um, so just remember as we start the school year, um, remember to, um, uh, please remember to, um, to listen, um, remember to follow my directions and also remember, um, going into the school year, it's going to be very stress. Uh, it's going to be, um, um, it's going to be a lot of fun. So, um, just remember, um, also to, um, be kind to one another as well."
322,4,"Sit up. You need to sit up. Well, I am sitting up. Stop. You need to pay attention. Will. I'm paying attention. Sh"
322,5,"You will. Hey, you guys can have your eyes up here, please. Hi. Yeah, that's great."
322,6,"Okay, teacher."
322,7,"Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, yeah. Do you guys have any questions?"
322,8,Nope.
322,9,"Nope? Okay. Alrighty. Um, great. I, we can probably get started. We can get started on our Austin."
322,10,"Oh, well, we have to make up the norms. We have to talk about the rules teacher. Like, one of the norms I think we should do is that no cell phones in the class."
322,11,"No cell phones in class. Um, yes. Um, of course. Um, uh, yeah. Um,"
322,12,"<laugh>, I'm so tired."
322,13,"Hey, will you? Doing okay?"
322,14,Yeah. I'm just tired.
322,15,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah. Um, great. Um,"
322,16,I get a text from my phone.
322,17,"Hey, Emily. Um, hi Emily, um, texting"
322,18,Me.
322,19,"Hey, <laugh>, can you please put your phone away? Um, I'll have to take it away. Okay, thanks. Okay."
322,20,"Hey, Emily, are you coming to my birthday party this week? Um, I think so. I can ask my mom about it though."
322,21,Jayla. Hey Jayla.
322,22,My mom needs to go if you're coming. Hmm. Yeah.
322,23,"Um, Jayla and Emily, um, you guys can talk about that at recess. Okay."
322,24,"Okay,"
322,25,"Great. Thank you. Um, okay."
322,26,I got a norm
322,27,"<laugh>. Um, what's, what is, um, sure. Jeb <laugh>."
322,28,"Um, I think like everybody has to focus. That should be one of our norms."
322,29,"That's great. Yeah. Yeah. No, uh, I really like that. Yeah."
322,30,"<laugh>. Okay. I'm gonna, um, I'm gonna write that down. Okay. But guys, I saw, um, the, uh, you know, I saw the, uh, Marvel movie this summer. They were so cool. Did anybody else see him? I love Marvel movies. This is so good. Emily, did you see it? Um, wow, I loved it. I might see it again. Um, you think that, um, you might wanna go?"
322,31,"Yeah. Um, um, Carlos,"
322,32,"Um,"
322,33,"Hey Carlos, thank you for sharing that. Um, but again, let's save that for later. Okay."
322,34,"Um, okay,"
322,35,"Great. Thanks. Yeah. Um, I, Emily"
322,36,Touching other people's things.
322,37,"That's a great one. No, thank you for bringing that up. Yeah. Um, yeah, I, yeah, no, um, I brought up the norm earlier about being kind to one another, so yeah, I think being respectful in that way is also important, so yeah. It's a good one. Yeah. Um, um,"
322,38,"Hi Mina, do we have a book report due today? I dunno. I don't think so. Will. Ok. Cause I missed it, I think. I don't think I did. I don't have my book report. Do you think it's today? Will, why don't you pass someone else? Well, I thought you would know."
322,39,I thought you would
322,40,Know me
322,41,"Will, don't worry. It's okay. It's okay. Yeah, we don't have that book report due today, so you don't have to worry about that. Okay. Um, yeah. Um,"
322,42,"Uh, this is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?"
322,43,"Um, oh, Jayla, I'm sorry to hear that. It's boring, but, um, it's really important to go over, um, just class rules, um, so we know what to, um, expect going into the, going into the school year."
322,44,Oh yeah. Okay. Teacher. Gotcha.
322,45,Yeah. Yeah.
322,46,And simulation. Thank you for.
323,0,Begin simulation.
323,1,Hi class.
323,2,Hi teacher.
323,3,I'm Ms. Hess. What are some of your names?
323,4,"I'm Nina. I'm y, I'm Jayla."
323,5,I'm Emily.
323,6,I'm Carlos.
323,7,Nice to meet you all. Welcome back from summer vacation.
323,8,Thanks.
323,9,Today we're gonna be going over our classroom norms. Does anybody know what classroom norms are?
323,10,"Uh, yeah."
323,11,"Yes, Carlos?"
323,12,"Yeah, those are the rules. Um, I have one. I would like just suggest a norm of no cell phone."
323,13,I like that one. Thank you for sharing that. Anyone else?
323,14,"Well sit up, pay attention. Im paying attention,"
323,15,Nina.
323,16,Yeah.
323,17,Can you please pay attention?
323,18,Yep.
323,19,Thank you. So the two classroom norms that I would like to go over are respecting each other and respecting ourselves. So Nina just gave us a great example of how we can respect each other.
323,20,My mom is sending me a text. I wonder. Wonderful. Forgot
323,21,Something.
323,22,"Emily, if there's something you wanna share?"
323,23,"Text. Oh, my mom just sent me a text."
323,24,"Oh, I think Carlos had a great idea of not having our phones."
323,25,"Oh,"
323,26,Do you mind putting your phone away?
323,27,Okay.
323,28,"Thank you. So, like I said, classroom norms are going to be,"
323,29,We stayed up too late last night.
323,30,"Sleepy. Well, are you a little sleepy?"
323,31,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Yeah.
323,32,"Yeah. Well, I'm sure you can get some rest when you go home, but right now we're in the classroom. Okay."
323,33,Okay. Okay. I'm awake.
323,34,Thank you. Does anyone else have any class norms that they would like to propose?
323,35,"Hey, Emily, are you gonna come to my uh, jump today after school? Yes. Is,"
323,36,I think that would be defined as not respecting each other as one of our classroom norms.
323,37,Okay. Sorry.
323,38,"Thank you. Does anyone have any idea ideas? Jayla, do you have any ideas for a classroom norm?"
323,39,"Um, yeah. Everybody has to, um, respect everybody else's time when they're talking."
323,40,"I like that. Hmm. So when I'm talking, we should respect what I'm saying, right?"
323,41,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>?
323,42,Yes. Thank you.
323,43,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.
323,44,Anyone else?
323,45,"Um, guys, I saw the, um, the new, um, Ironman movie this summer. It was so good. Did you guys see it? Marvel movies. Emily, did you see it?"
323,46,"Hmm. Thank you so much for sharing that. I, I really like that you're so interested in that, but we're talking about our classroom norms. Would you like anything else to share?"
323,47,"Uh, no. Thank you."
323,48,"Okay. Will Nina, Emily?"
323,49,"Um, well, everybody should be prepared, um, for school. Yeah. Like, have other stuff with them when they get to school."
323,50,And being prepared also means getting a good night's rest. So make sure that you're not sleeping in class and you're sleeping when you're at home at night and coming to school. Ready to learn.
323,51,Yes.
323,52,"Nina, Emily?"
323,53,Yeah.
323,54,Do you have any classroom norms you'd like to share?
323,55,"Um, I don't think so."
323,56,"Okay. Emily, anything?"
323,57,"Hey, um, Nina, do we have a book report due today? I dunno. Will"
323,58,Will Nina.
323,59,"Well, uh, yeah, but we might have one. I'm not sure. I may have forgot that. Yeah,"
323,60,"Right. Now's not the time to talk about that. Remember, one of our, one of our norms is that we're respecting each other and we're not gonna talk when the teacher is talking, or our classmates are sharing something."
323,61,"Oh, this is, this is so boring. Why are we doing this again?"
323,62,"Well, classroom norms are very important to make our space and each other comfortable and feel safe."
323,63,All right.
323,64,"So, although it may seem kind of boring, it is really important. Okay. We wanna respect everybody and we wanna respect our classroom."
323,65,Okay. Okay. And simulation. Thank you for your time completing that.
324,0,Begin simulation. Hi teacher.
324,1,Hey guys. Can you hear me?
324,2,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.
324,3,I saw that everyone had a good vacation.
324,4,"Yeah, it was good. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. That's good. How was your vacation?"
324,5,"It was really good. It was really good. But now let's get focused onto school. And now that we're in a setting where we learn, let's review some classroom norms just in case that we didn't forget while we were having fun during vacation. Does that sound okay?"
324,6,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.
324,7,Okay. Could anyone tell me what are some norms that we all discussed as a class previously?
324,8,"Um, I think we said no cell phones last year. Is that right?"
324,9,"Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. That's a good one. Why should we not have cell phones? So that we can be focused and stay in tune, right?"
324,10,Sit up.
324,11,Sit up.
324,12,I am sitting up.
324,13,Hey Nina. And Will
324,14,Could
324,15,"You guys listen? Yeah. I think this is one great example of what we should not do, right? When Carlos was talking, what is something that we should have done instead of talking to each other?"
324,16,"Um, listen."
324,17,"Right? Yeah. So let's move on. Let's kind of tie that into our classroom norms. I think something that I really like is respect and that is something that should always be, um, in our classroom. Text"
324,18,"From my mom. My mom is,"
324,19,"Hey Emily. Text Well. Hey Emily, what was our first role that Carlos kind of talked about in the beginning? He said no cell phones, right?"
324,20,"Oh, sorry. Okay."
324,21,"Yeah. And Nina, well this is a good example what we should be doing. Good job for being very quiet and attentive to me as I was talking. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Good job guys. What are other norms that we can bring up to the class? What are other rules to abide by?"
324,22,I stayed up too late last night. I'm
324,23,"Hey Will, is that very important to the conversation or is that distracting the learning of others?"
324,24,"What's that? Sorry. Straight up, late"
324,25,Last night. Sit up. Hi. Yeah. Sit up and head up. Hi.
324,26,Good job.
324,27,Alright. Good job. Does anyone else have any ideas on what classroom norms that we want?
324,28,"Are you gonna jump today after school? Um, I dunno. I ask my mom. That's probably why she texted"
324,29,Kayla and Emily.
324,30,"Most of us are gonna meet there. Yeah. Kayla, Emily."
324,31,Mm-hmm. <affirmative> Is that being respectful to our class and our time? Are you respecting ma'am? My time here?
324,32,"No, sorry."
324,33,"Yes. I, this is all a really good reminder of what we should, we should focus back onto school and the setting that we're in. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> where we are learning and being respectful. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> and being kind and passionate towards other people as we're talking. And especially to me, we're trying to respect me as much as we are respecting each other. And I know that you guys don't wanna be interrupted when you guys are talking, right? Why would I just slump on my chair?"
324,34,"I tell you, teacher, I saw the Ironman Ironman movies. Um, uh,"
324,35,"Well Carlos, is that relevant talking about right now? Is that relevant?"
324,36,I dunno. I just love those Marvel movies. Teacher.
324,37,"Yeah, I understand that, Carlos. But could we save that for another discussion time? Maybe during recess maybe, or lunch. But not right now. Cuz we're reviewing and it's my time that you are respecting. Yes. Emily?"
324,38,"Um, well I was thinking a classroom norm. Yeah. It could be respectful of people's space, like around them at their desks. Like not catching other people's thing."
324,39,"Yeah. I really like that. I, I think it's important because it is our own material and since we mm-hmm <affirmative> have brought our own thing, it is respectful to be respectful of other people's space and Yeah. Yeah. Do you have more to say, Emily? Is that good? I really like that. Thank you for contributing to the conversation. Does anyone else have any class norms that we wanna include in our Nina?"
324,40,Do we have a book report due today? Cause I think I forgot it. I think we were supposed to write one for today. Nina. I don't know.
324,41,"Hey guys, I couldn't wait for you guys cause the time is just running out and"
324,42,"Well, I was wondering if we should get a book report. Yes. Yes. Sorry,"
324,43,What do we just talk about? Could you tell me what the classroom norms are? What have we discussed so far?
324,44,"Oh, this is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?"
324,45,We are doing this because there's instances like right now where we are not respecting my time and the time of others and we should be staying in tune with the classroom and what we're learning because we don't wanna disrupt other people while we're learning. I know. Okay. Other people haven't contributing. Right.
324,46,And simulation.
325,0,"It's time for your session to start, begin simulation."
325,1,Hi teacher.
325,2,Hi everyone. How are you?
325,3,"Good, good."
325,4,"Awesome. So today we're, I hope you had a nice vacation. As we come back together as a group, I just wanna go over some norms and expectations we have in our classroom community. How does that sound to you?"
325,5,"Uh, that sounds good. I think we should have one, um, of no cell phones."
325,6,"Oh, okay. What are you thinking, Carlos?"
325,7,No cell phones.
325,8,No cell phones. Okay. So keeping our cell phones away for the day when we're in our classroom.
325,9,"No. Will sit up. I'm sitting up. Mina. No, you weren't,"
325,10,Weren't listening. Nina and Will Here. Eyes up here friends.
325,11,Hi Nina.
325,12,"We're gonna do a couple together. That's okay. We're gonna do a couple together as a group and I think Carlos has us off to a great start. So as, as a reminder, if you have something to share, please raise your hand. Hi mom. Send"
325,13,A text. I wonder what I forgot at home.
325,14,"Oh, that's okay. Emily. We can check that with you and maybe we can even check that together. But right now"
325,15,"Texting me,"
325,16,"I wonder too, but let's, let's keep your phone away for now. As Carlos reminded us, that's one of our rules as a class. We're gonna keep our phones away for the day. I'm tired."
325,17,I'm so tired. We stayed up too late last night.
325,18,"Oh, are you tired? Will,"
325,19,Yeah.
325,20,"Okay. Well one thing that I want us to remember, and it's really the main thing is to respect each other and respect ourselves. Does anyone have an example of what that might look like in our classroom?"
325,21,"Hey Emily, are you coming to jump today? Um, I dunno. Jayla, maybe if my mom lets me. Well, a lot of kids are gonna be there after school, so if you wanna meet the flag. Maybe my mom ride. Okay."
325,22,"Yeah,"
325,23,I'd like to go.
325,24,Can I have your attention up here please?
325,25,Yes.
325,26,"Awesome. So would either of you like to share a way that we can respect each other and ourselves in our classroom community? Yeah. Jayla, thanks for raising your hand. Um,"
325,27,"Yeah, just, um, like to, uh, everybody needs to focus."
325,28,"Oh, okay. So what does that look like? Could you give us an example?"
325,29,"Yeah, just like, um, listen to you and raise your hand before you talk. Like no side conversations."
325,30,"Oh, okay. So this idea of side conversations. What do you think we should do if we have a really important thought and we wanna share it with our neighbor? Oh,"
325,31,I have one. I just saw the Ironman movies this summer and I loved them. They were so good. Can I tell you all about those? Has anyone seen them? I love Marvel movie movies.
325,32,"Hmm. That is, that is an awesome question. I wonder if we could practice together what we would do if we wanted to share that idea. But we're supposed to be listening to the teacher or listening to one of our classmates. Oh, right. What do you think is a good idea to do? If you have that idea in your mind and you say, oh, I wanna tell my, I wanna tell my neighbor this, but you realize that we're supposed to be paying attention upfront. What do you think you should do instead?"
325,33,"Um, well raise your hand."
325,34,Okay. So raise your hand and would you wanna share with the whole class?
325,35,"Um, maybe. Yeah,"
325,36,"Maybe. Okay. So that's one idea. We can raise our hand. Emily, is that a hand?"
325,37,"I was just saying we should, um, classroom norm at being respectful of other people's face, like not touching other people's things."
325,38,"Oh, good one. So part of being respectful at each other"
325,39,"Book? No, I dunno. Well, I thought we had a book report now we have to do. Okay."
325,40,"Hey, well, we'll talk about the before soon, okay. Remember no side conversations. I know it's hard."
325,41,"Yeah, this is boring. Why are we doing this again, teacher?"
325,42,"Well, we have to come together as a group and talk about our norms before we can begin our lesson. Are you all excited to"
325,43,<laugh> End simulation?
326,0,"Begin simulation. Hi, teacher."
326,1,"Hello, class."
326,2,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.
326,3,"Hi,"
326,4,"Uh, welcome back, uh, to, to school. Um, I hope you all had a wonderful break. Um, it"
326,5,Was good. How was your grade teacher?
326,6,"Oh, my break was pretty good. Uh, yeah. Um, I,"
326,7,"Well, you need to pay attention. I am paying attention. You're not sitting up. I am sitting up straight. Nina. Mind your own business. Well, I mean, you gotta listen to the teacher es You're not gonna learn anything. Mina. It's the first day of school. What are you talking about? He's going over the rules. Well, I mean, so what, why don't you just leave me alone?"
326,8,Oh.
326,9,"Oh. Uh, why don't we take some time to, it's been a while since we've seen each other. Uh, why don't we take some time to review our class norms?"
326,10,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah.
326,11,"So, uh,"
326,12,"Oh. Text from my mother. I wonder, I forgot something."
326,13,Oh.
326,14,Oh. She keeps texting me.
326,15,Oh.
326,16,"Oh, my mom. Is she sending me texts? Oh, I am tired. I stayed up too late last night."
326,17,"Can anybody, uh, remind me or the class, uh, what are norms, what our classroom norms were about? Uh, oh,"
326,18,"Yes. Why can, um, well, we had one, I think was no cell phones in class. That was one of our rules last year."
326,19,Yes. Thank you Carlos. No cell phones in class. That's right.
326,20,"Emily, are you going to jump today? I dunno. That's probably why my mom texting to see if I wanted to go. Yeah, you gotta go because everybody's coming. First day at school thing. Jump."
326,21,Emily.
326,22,Ok. But see.
326,23,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.
326,24,"Yes. Emily, uh, was there, was there a question for me? The class?"
326,25,"Oh, no. Listening."
326,26,"Oh, okay. Um, could you, uh, would it be all right? Oh, yes."
326,27,"I got a rule. Like, I think like, um, everybody needs to focus."
326,28,Everybody needs to focus.
326,29,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah.
326,30,"Um, um,"
326,31,"That's good. Okay. But you guys, I saw the Marvel movies this summer. I saw, like, I watched all of them again at home and then I went to see the Iron Man was so good. Did you wanna, um, I could tell everybody what, um, what it was about, unless you haven't seen it yet. But I love the Marvel movies. Do you like them? Teacher?"
326,32,"Uh, yes. Uh, unfortunately I have not seen those movies yet. So if, if you could please re um, hold off on some of the discussion. I, uh, and avoid some spoilers. Uh, yes. I"
326,33,"Have, um, needs to be respectful of other people's, like, no running, no touching other people's face."
326,34,"That's a, that's a good norm. Um, thanks. Could else? Yes. Could anybody else, uh, maybe, uh, go, uh, give another example of what that might look like?"
326,35,Know? Do we have a book report? Do today?
326,36,"Will,"
326,37,"I don't know. Well, I, if we have a book report due today, I thought we had a book report too on the first day of school. Oh, I dunno. Will you, you have to be quiet and listen. Okay. Sorry."
326,38,Will
326,39,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah.
326,40,"Will, was that a suggestion for the class?"
326,41,"Oh, this is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?"
326,42,"That's a good question. J Uh, why are we doing this again? Could anybody make"
326,43,And simulate.
327,0,Begin simulation. Hi teacher.
327,1,Hi guys. How are you doing?
327,2,"Good, good. How are you?"
327,3,"I'm doing well. Okay guys. So before we get started and hear about all the awesome things that we did over our break, I definitely wanna make sure that we go over some of the really important things that we should do while we're in our classroom every single day, okay?"
327,4,"Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. I think that we should have one for, um, like a rule of, for no cell phone."
327,5,"Ooh, no. Cell phone's a good one. That's in our school policy too. So that's something that we should all keep in mind when we're in our school. Okay."
327,6,"Hey, well you need to sit up. I am setting up. Be quiet. Well, you need to sit"
327,7,Anna And Will Anna and Will.
327,8,I'm Hey.
327,9,Hi guys. Yes.
327,10,Hi.
327,11,"So go ahead and keep all eyes on me. Let's go over some of the most important ones, okay? Okay. So for number one, I think that we should all have respect of each other. What does respect mean, guys?"
327,12,"Um, it just means that like, you listen, you don't interrupt people, that kinda thing,"
327,13,"Right? So when we're talking, we wanna be mindful of what other people are saying."
327,14,"Oh, I got a text from my mom. Why is she sending me a text?"
327,15,"Hey, Emily, after we have our five minute break, you'll be able to check your phone, okay? Right now I would like you to put it away,"
327,16,Okay? Thank you.
327,17,"Okay. Awesome. Number two, I wanna make sure that we make sure that we lead our words with kindness."
327,18,This
327,19,"Is one that you don't like. Oh, no,"
327,20,I'm tired.
327,21,"See, that seems like something that we should talk about on our break. Okay. How can you lead with your words with kindness? Can someone give me an example?"
327,22,"Um, well speak with kindness. Um, I'm not sure"
327,23,When you wanna speak to someone else. Do you speak
327,24,"To them? Are you going jump today? Um, I dunno if I can go Jayla. My mom did. Well, maybe you can text her. Maybe you can text her and ask her. You can go to jump. Emily,"
327,25,"Do you remember what Carlos said earlier about our,"
327,26,Like
327,27,Girls?
327,28,"Oops, sorry. Yes."
327,29,"Right, right. So when you're talking to me, I expect it to be with kindness. And when you're talking to each other, I also expect it to be with kindness,"
327,30,Okay?
327,31,"Okay? Yep. And the last one that I want us to think about is allowing time to think before you speak. Okay? So before you start talking out loud, make sure that you're thinking about what you're going to say before you say it. Okay?"
327,32,"Oh yeah. I mean, I, um, oh, I just saw the Ironman movie. I can't wait to tell you all about it unless you haven't seen it. I don't wanna be a spoiler, but see,"
327,33,I haven't
327,34,"Seen it yet. Love Marvel movies. Um,"
327,35,"Yeah, I know. So do I I haven't seen it yet though, Carlos, so we're"
327,36,"Gonna have to, do you wanna? Okay."
327,37,Okay. Are there any questions about our three rules in our classroom? No. I have
327,38,One though. I have one.
327,39,"Yes. Emily? Um,"
327,40,"I think there should be one that, um, like being respectful of other people's space, like not running or touching other people's stuff,"
327,41,"Right? So that goes a lot with our first one of respect of each other, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, that doesn't just mean mm-hmm. <affirmative> talk. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. That also means when we're interacting with someone, right? Awesome. I love those head nods. Exactly."
327,42,"Mina, do we have a book report due today? Mina. I dunno. Well, it's the first day of school."
327,43,It's first day.
327,44,"We had to bring a book report with us on the first day of school. Mina, what do you know? I don't know. Will you better listen to the teacher? Well, I mean, but can you tell me if we have a book report too? Mina."
327,45,"Mina. We'll, why don't you wait until we're done and then we can all talk about what's due in your classes and what should we look for?"
327,46,This is boring. This is boring. Why are we doing this again?
327,47,"Why are we doing this? Because we wanna make sure that we are all on the same page before getting started with all of our new material that we're learning. Oh, yeah."
327,48,"Right, right. Sorry about that. Gotcha."
327,49,"All righty, everyone. So remember that we're respecting each other, that we are leading with kindness"
327,50,And simulation. Thank you.
328,0,"Begin simulation. Hi, teacher."
328,1,Hi. How y'all doing?
328,2,Good.
328,3,"It's a great day. So, uh, welcome. So today we're actually gonna go, we're gonna go over a couple of norms and expectations I expect from all yous in class. Uh, and I think the number one, first thing that we need to cross close the pay attention in here is be respectful of each other. If someone's talking over, if someone's talking, I'm giving you an answer, don't interrupt this person. If someone's working on something, don't interrupt that person who is working. Okay. That brings to another part, is like, make sure y'all pay attention, okay? Cause I definitely want you all to succeed and I want you to progress nicely and learn. We're gonna make this a nice, enjoyable environment. Okay? Well"
328,4,"Understand. You need to pay attention. I'm paying attention, Nina. Yeah, but you need to sit straight. I quiet."
328,5,"It's okay. I understand what you're doing, but it's good. All right. But it's mind. Be mindful here. We're gonna respect each other here. All right? So, mm-hmm. <affirmative>, one thing here is if there there are any issues, don't be afraid to speak up. Okay? I want, I want y'all,"
328,6,I got text from my mom. Why is she texting me again?
328,7,You doing okay?
328,8,"Yeah. I just got a text from my mom, so I wonder if I forgot something at home."
328,9,Okay. Just
328,10,Checking in. Just checking my text.
328,11,"Okay. Uh, Emily, we're currently in classroom right now, so if it's something that can be done later time, I appreciate it. You can put up your phone,"
328,12,"Please. Okay. Okay, teacher."
328,13,Thank you. Okay. Appreciate it.
328,14,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.
328,15,"All right. So, alright."
328,16,Are you tired?
328,17,"Yeah, I, I know, I know will a long thing, but you know, just power through, we'll get, we'll do just fine. Okay?"
328,18,Okay. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-hmm.
328,19,"<affirmative>. Okay. Good, good. All. And"
328,20,"Emily, are you going jump after school? Emily,"
328,21,"Jayla, I"
328,22,"Dunno. Jayla, I dunno. Mom,"
328,23,I'm little's. Just pay.
328,24,Yes. Teacher. Mm-hmm.
328,25,"<affirmative>. Thank you. I great. Appreciate it. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So, uh, and another important thing that I need to focus on is there are no wrong answers. If I call on y'all to give a question, if I ask a question, call on somebody can answer this question, Jayla."
328,26,"Yeah. I think one of our norms should be like, everybody's got a focus."
328,27,"Yes. That's exactly what I'm yes. For bringing that up. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, that's actually correct. That's actually the something, second thing that I brought up. It's important to pay attention. Okay. So thank you for paying attention. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Uh, but let me finish the thought, uh, that we all, there are no wrong answers, so if you feel like you know the answer, feel free to speak up, raise your hand, speak up, and I will."
328,28,"Have you seen the Ironman movies? I saw those this summer. They were so cool. You guys. Have you seen any of the Marvel movies? Oh gosh. Oh man. Yes. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Uh,"
328,29,"Yeah, I do love Ironman, but you know, we can talk about that at later time. Okay."
328,30,"Okay. Okay, great."
328,31,"But as I said before, there are no wrong answers here. Okay. Just, you know, uh, just speak up and then we will see, uh, how we can, if it's correct or if it's not, then we can guide along. So what's the correct answer, Emily?"
328,32,"Um, yeah, I think that, um, one of our norms should be like, people should be respectful of other people's face. Like not running or touching other people's things."
328,33,"Yes, that's correct. Make sure you make sure you don't invade other people's personal spaces. Every person has their own, uh, space that they like to stay with or from, from afar. Some people like to be close to other people, some not so much. So it's important"
328,34,"Book report today. Well, I'm not sure"
328,35,"Right now, so, so, you know, we can talk after"
328,36,"Work. Sure, sure. Yeah. Is that ok?"
328,37,"Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah, it's not a problem. It's ok. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So, as I was saying, as I was saying, it's uh, make sure, don't just invade other people's spaces. Just make sure, uh, ask if it is okay to actually come a little bit closer or not, but if they're not okay with it, make sure you respect whatever they,"
328,38,"Ah, this is boring. This is boring. Why are we doing this again,"
328,39,"We're doing this because we, I want you all to succeed in class and this perhaps you provide, be more comfortable in the classroom because Oh. At being comfortable in the classroom that you are more willing to learn. Okay. I want this to be, I want this place to be just like home. You know? You'd be comfortable home as a Australian"
328,40,Statue. Cool. Okay. That'd be nice.
328,41,Yeah. Plus you'll be hanging out with your friends
328,42,End simulation. Thank you for your time completing that simulation. I hope you have a one.
329,0,"Begin simulation, my teacher."
329,1,Hi class. How are y'all today? Hello.
329,2,"Good, how are you?"
329,3,I'm good. How was your day?
329,4,Good. We just got back from vacation.
329,5,That's awesome. Where'd y'all go?
329,6,Summer vacation.
329,7,Cool. That's cool. So today in class I wanna talk about classroom norms. Do you know what classroom norms are?
329,8,"Yeah, it's the rules."
329,9,Yeah. Do you have an example of what one of those rules might be?
329,10,"Well, you need to pay attention. The teachers talking. I am paying attention. Mina, be quiet. I know, but you're not sitting up straight. I am sitting up straight. Nina, be quiet. Can you hear the teacher Nina? She's talking. Nina."
329,11,"Nina, please"
329,12,Be quiet and leave me alone.
329,13,"Nina. Yeah, please."
329,14,Okay.
329,15,Okay. So that's actually a really great example of a class norm that we could have is respecting personal boundaries. What does that mean?
329,16,"Oh no. I got a text from my mom. Oh, brother. Why is she texting me? I must have forgotten something. I gotta check my text."
329,17,Is everything okay Emily?
329,18,"Um, well my mom sent me a text, so I'm just wondering why. I'm just checking it."
329,19,"Okay. Make sure everything's all right with your mom. But once you're done with that, make sure you put your phone away, okay?"
329,20,Okay.
329,21,Okay.
329,22,I tired. I stayed up too late last night.
329,23,"That's relatable. Will. Um, so back to class norms. Someone mentioned Will, will have you fallen asleep."
329,24,"Well, no, I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. Sorry."
329,25,I'm here.
329,26,Okay.
329,27,"Okay. Thank you for waking up. When I, um, question. That's a great example of respect. That's one of the question."
329,28,"Are you going to the fun zone? Um, I"
329,29,"Don't Jayla, I"
329,30,"Dunno. I dunno. Jayla, I check my mom. Okay. After school. Excuse."
329,31,"So that's, yeah. So when I'm talking as a teacher, it's, I find it very respectful when y'all are quiet and listen and that will be reciprocated. So when y'all talk to me, I will also be listening to you. Yes, Jayla."
329,32,"Yes, ma'am. Um, like, yeah, I think one of our norms should be like, everybody needs to focus."
329,33,"Yeah. That's a really, really great norm. Um"
329,34,Mm-hmm.
329,35,"<affirmative>, that's really good for the classroom because that'll keep us on task and it'll help us learn the material that we need to learn."
329,36,"Yeah. Yeah. But guys, I saw the new Iron Man movie this summer and it was so cool. But we talk about that. I love Marvel movies. Oh my gosh, that was such a great movie."
329,37,That is a really great movie. I'm glad you got to see such a cool movie over summer break. But do you think that we could hold that conversation for maybe during lunch or after class? I would love to talk to you about that another time.
329,38,"Oh, oh, okay. Thanks teacher."
329,39,"Whoa. Of course. Um,"
329,40,Let's see.
329,41,"Yeah, so what Jayla was saying, oh yes, Emily."
329,42,"Um, well I was thinking that we could have a norm that like everybody needs to respect everybody's space. Like not running, not touching other people's things, that kinda stuff."
329,43,"Absolutely. That's a wonderful normal, I'll write that down. Um, as well as Jay's that she brought up earlier, that is a great norm because it reminds ourselves to keep within our own boundaries and respect other people's because people might have different boundaries."
329,44,"And we do, we have a book report due today. I dunno, but you're interrupting. I dunno if have book thought. Somebody said something on."
329,45,Excuse me. Will
329,46,Mina. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah.
329,47,"Do you remember our, um, our class Norm about staying quiet when someone else is talking?"
329,48,Oh yeah. Sorry.
329,49,"No, you're totally fine. Um, at class norms take a lot of practice and I'm proud of you guys for workshops. This"
329,50,"Is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?"
329,51,"Well, it's so, it's boring. Some things in life are boring, but that doesn't mean that they're not important. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you have to go through the everyday things because these establishing these norms are gonna make it. So we have a great class this entire year, which I am very excited about starting with you guys."
329,52,Okay. Teacher? Yeah.
329,53,Yeah.
329,54,"Oh, thank you."
330,0,Begin simulation.
330,1,Hello class. How are you guys today?
330,2,"Hi, teacher. Good."
330,3,"Hello, Jayla. Okay, so today we're work on reviewing our classroom norms that we earlier in the year. Um, so the first we're gonna review is that our voices matter so that we can, something that there's multiple parts of this. The first is that we don't talk over each other. We'd rather listen to whoever's talking. So if I'm talking or Nina's talking or Will's talking, we'll listen to them instead of trying to talk over each"
330,4,"Other. Well, you need to listen to the teacher. I am listening to the teacher. You need to sit up straight. I am sitting up straight. Mina"
330,5,In the Mina. Are you wearing about yourself or are you wearing about will
330,6,Myself. Sorry.
330,7,"Thanks. Yeah. It's important to remember that when we talk about our voices mattering, we can also focus on how our words have an impact and our words. You can use them either to build each other up or tear each other down. And as a teacher, it's my job to worry about all of you guys, but as student teachers have to worry about yourself in your lane."
330,8,My mom is sending me a text again. Now I gotta check my text.
330,9,"Hey Emily, I know that they're so important to talk to your mom, but can we choose a different time to talk to her? So maybe we could put the phone away for right now."
330,10,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Okay.
330,11,"Yeah. Another one of our norms that kinda ties into, um, well, we were already talking about, Hey."
330,12,Too late last night. I'm tired.
330,13,"No, it's un understandable that you're tired, you're very busy. Can you try to sit up straight and maybe take your legs down so you can wake your body up and then you can"
330,14,Rest so much. Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm awake.
330,15,"Yeah, you got it. Okay. So our second costume norm is that we'll take care of others. Um, does anybody have any ideas to what this could mean?"
330,16,"Emily, are you going to jump tomorrow yet? Are you gonna go going?"
330,17,"We're this weekend right now. Okay. That's all right. Thanks for apologizing. Okay. Who can tell me what it means to take care of others? Does anybody have any ideas? Um, go ahead, Jayla."
330,18,"Uh, well like, be kind and like, um, like focus on, you know, everything that you're supposed to be doing. Like focus on yourself and let other people focus on themselves."
330,19,"Yeah, exactly. But we can also, something that ties into this is placing others' needs and knowing what they are or trying to anticipate the needs of others and putting them above the needs of ours. So for example, if you're in line at ticket water from the water fountain, you can let somebody go before you if you know that they're running late to something and they have more of a rush than you do. You don't have to do that every"
330,20,Somebody. I saw that in the Marvel Movers. Oh gosh. I saw that Ironman movie teacher. It was so good. I love Marvel movies. Oh my gosh.
330,21,"I love Marvel movies too. Carlos, can we talk about those at a different time? We just have one more classroom to review. We can do it. Okay. Okay. The last classroom is that we'll take care of our space. So this includes taking care of our supplies and our tools. Also the classroom itself. So we can work to lead it cleaner than we found it. We can go ahead. Emily, what'd you have to share?"
330,22,"Yeah, I was gonna just, um, say that like, like take care of like your own space and don't touch other people's things."
330,23,"Yeah, that's a great point Emily. We want respect that other people's belongings are personal. They may not want us missing with them cause maybe they're special to them or we just want, it's a great opportunity you can share with your friends, but always ask before you touch somebody else's what,"
330,24,<affirmative>. Okay.
330,25,"Thank you so much. Does anybody have any other things that they think are important to help their learning go well? So if you can think of something that either you can do, your classmates can do, or I can do to help your learning. What is it?"
330,26,"Uh, this is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?"
330,27,"We're doing this so that we can have a productive learning environment. It helps us all learn better. When you talk about expectations, it may not seem really fun right now. Oh yeah. But it'll help our learning to be more fun later. Yeah. Yeah."
330,28,You're right. Okay.
330,29,"Can somebody think of an example of what it looks like to follow one of the three classroom norms, which are our voices matter and that we will take care of others and we'll take care of our space. Can somebody can give an example of something they can do?"
330,30,Hmm.
330,31,Thank you.
331,0,"Okay, it's time for your session to start begin simulation."
331,1,Hi
331,2,Everyone. Welcome back.
331,3,Hi.
331,4,"Hi. So we're just gonna review how we're going to, um, act in class and act toward our spaces and each other, um, since we're coming back for break. So we are going focus on three things. The first thing is taking care of ourselves. The second one is taking care of others, and the third one is taking care of our spaces."
331,5,"Well, you need to sit up straight. I sitting up quiet. You're not listening to the teacher. Yes, I Well pay attention. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah, sorry."
331,6,"So this actually goes to our first norm, which is respecting others. So we're going to, um, actively listen to each other and also actively listen to me when I'm talking, um, and use kind words to each other. So we're gonna let the teacher do the teaching. Um, we're going to listen. Um, and yeah, just treat other people how we would want to be treated. Um, and then the second thing is respecting ourselves. Um, we're gonna focus"
331,7,My mom. Why is my mom texting me right now?
331,8,"Hey, Emily, can we wait till after, um, till after class to text your mom? Awesome."
331,9,"Oh, sure."
331,10,"Thank you. Um, so we're just gonna stay focused, um, and we're gonna try our best on our work so that we can respect ourselves."
331,11,I did not get enough sleep last night. I'm sleepy.
331,12,"I'm sorry. You're sleepy. That's the worst. Um, maybe we can get better sleep for tomorrow. Will, could you, um, tell me how we can respect our spaces? Do you remember how we respect our spaces in the classroom?"
331,13,"Um, well, like I, um, not bothering other people's stuff. Keeping your stuff in your own space."
331,14,"Awesome. Yeah. So we try to keep, um, all of our materials in the place."
331,15,"Hey, are you gonna go tomorrow? Okay. Out tomorrow? Hmm."
331,16,"Could you guys tell me, um, how we can respect our spaces in the classroom?"
331,17,"Um, by not, um, like keeping your stuff, um, like on your desk and not like, you know, bothering other people's papers and stuff. Keeping it neat."
331,18,"Awesome. Yeah. If we keep it neat, then we can focus on our schoolwork and it can help our learning best."
331,19,"Yeah, I think we need to have a norm focus."
331,20,"Awesome. Focus is also part of respecting ourselves. It's under that one. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> <affirmative>. So besides respecting ourselves, does anyone remember what else we talked about? Um, what our other two norms are so we can review before we start. Carlos."
331,21,"Oh, can I tell you first that I saw the, um, Ironman movie this summer and it was so good. I love the Marvel movies guys. Have you seen all the Marvel movies?"
331,22,Awesome.
331,23,"Oh man. Marvel movies. Ironman is the best, but"
331,24,Fun. Can we focus on school and answering my question right now?
331,25,"Oh, Uhhuh. Sorry. What did you ask?"
331,26,"Um, so can we just go back over our three, um, norms for our classroom? Carlos, could you tell me one of them?"
331,27,"Um, respecting other people's space."
331,28,"Awesome. Emily, do you have another classroom?"
331,29,"We should. When we're talking about like, respecting people's space, like it also means like not running, not touching other people's thing."
331,30,Awesome. So controlling our bodies. Yeah.
331,31,Yeah.
331,32,"Control our voices, which is part of that too, so we can control."
331,33,"Do we have a book report too today? What? I'm <inaudible> at school. Are you sure there's not a book we do today, Mina? Yeah."
331,34,"Well, a question."
331,35,"Oh, no ma'am."
331,36,"Okay. Could you tell me one other thing we're gonna do to, um, help each other's learning?"
331,37,"This is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again,"
331,38,Jayla? We're doing this because we need to remember how we're going to act in the classroom so we can help our learn the best. This.
331,39,"Oh, right. Good idea. Okay. Sorry."
331,40,"That's okay. How can you help your, um, friends learning in your own learning"
331,41,And simulation? Thank you for.
332,0,"Uh, to begin. So we will begin simulation."
332,1,"Okay. Hi students. I hope we had a good vacation. Do you guys wanna, does anyone wanna tell me what they did over the break?"
332,2,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Sure.
332,3,"Yeah, Carlos."
332,4,"Yeah. Um, you know, caught up with some movies and, uh, had a good time in general. Oh, cool. They just took it easy. Yeah. Good times. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>,"
332,5,I'm glad. Anyone else wanna share?
332,6,"Oh, well set up. Well, I am sitting in a You need to pay attention. Pay attention. Oh, I'm paying attention. Attention. What do you mean,"
332,7,"<laugh>? Okay, so we're all"
332,8,"Sorry. Gotta, sometimes he's easily distract. Distracted. So <laugh>,"
332,9,"Sorry. Ah, it's okay. Well, since we're all back, let's review our classroom norms again. Just to get back into the swing of things. Does anyone remember our classroom norms? We had our two,"
332,10,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm getting a phone call, um, from my mom. Oh no. I think I might have forgot something at home. I'm sorry. Oh,"
332,11,It's okay.
332,12,"Okay. Uh,"
332,13,"Yeah, let's remember. We can use our phone after school ends, but, okay. Sorry. I'll go over our rules again. So our, our first two were be respectful, be kind, and then always try your best. You guys remember? So what does respectful look like? What did we talk about before?"
332,14,Sorry. I'm sorry. I just said <laugh>. Oh. Stayed up too late last night. Sorry. Sorry about that. Fell
332,15,Asleep. Okay. Well it's okay.
332,16,"Jayla, are you having your birthday party today? Yeah, I trying to be, uh, yeah, it should be fine. 30. 30."
332,17,"So part of respect is we wanna listen to the person talking, so we'll just keep that in mind going for today. Okay."
332,18,Okay. Sorry. Yep. No problem. It's okay. Yeah.
332,19,"And then the last one was always try your best. So that's in any type of social situation. And anytime we're doing our work, even when it gets hard sometimes we'll just keep on trying. Okay. And we can encourage each other."
332,20,"I like that a lot. That's great. Um, oh, oh, uh, I just wanna mention, um, you know, I, I saw Ironman, uh, over the weekend for the first time. You know, I really haven't watched many of the Marvel movies, but, but I'll tell you, I am hooked. I'm hooked. Yeah. I don't know if you seen it the weekend watch. I dunno how many you've seen. I've only seen the first one, but, uh, but boy, uh, I'm gonna be busy this weekend watching all the other ones cause there's like a million of 'em. So anyway, I digress. <laugh>."
332,21,"Yeah, that's fun. It's okay. We can talk about our weekends, but when we start school we'll just focus on finishing our work."
332,22,"Hmm. John? Oh, um,"
332,23,"Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. What's up, Emily?"
332,24,"Yeah, I have a, I have an idea, like there would be a good, you know, um, rule for the class. Um, you know, like, uh, if, if you were like, respectful of people's space, you know, and like, not running or touching people's things, like just being respectful of other people's space, you know?"
332,25,Yeah. That's good. Yeah. So that goes along with the role of being respectful.
332,26,"Oh. Oh, Mina. Is there a book report due today? Well, it's like Thursday after vacation. Nothing is due. Yeah. But I, I, I dunno, I just wanna make sure. And I always like, uh, <laugh> always forget things, you know, <laugh>. Sorry. Sorry. It's okay. Forgive you."
332,27,Let's come back to our discussion. Does anyone else have any other rules we wanna implement?
332,28,"This is, um, this is kinda, uh, boring. Why are, why are we doing this?"
332,29,"Well, if we have firm classroom rules in the beginning, then it can set us up for success whenever we do anything later. So I just wanted to go over our rules for today."
332,30,Okay. That makes sense. That makes sense. I was just checking.
332,31,Thank you for your question.
332,32,Just checking in. No problem.
332,33,I just wanted to make sure we were all on the same page.
333,0,"Session to start. Uh, so we will begin simulation."
333,1,"Hey everyone. Welcome back from break. I'm so glad that you're all here. Um, how was your break?"
333,2,"Hey there. Oh, it was great. It was great. How was yours?"
333,3,"It was great. Thank you Carlos. Um, well I'm glad that we're back at school. I thought since we haven't been here, while we might talk about some of the things we like to do at school, some of our norms so that we could, so we could all regroup. Well, so one of the ones I was thinking of was attentive listening. Um, remember how we talked about that at the beginning of the year? Um, so that would mean, um,"
333,4,"Sit up. I am sitting up. What do you mean,"
333,5,Nina? Attention?
333,6,I'm paying attention.
333,7,Nina.
333,8,Attentive
333,9,"Listening means that it, it's one of our roles that falls under respect, right? So it means mm-hmm <affirmative> looking at someone who's talking, not talking when someone else is talking. Um, you wanna make sure other people know that you're listening to them fully. Jayla, do you have any ideas what attentive listening could be in our class? Do you remember?"
333,10,"Um, whoa. Uh, who is that's, sorry. That was a me. Sorry. That's my mom. She was just texting me. I think I left something at home. I'm sorry. Sorry about that. She's just texting <laugh>. Sorry. Sorry about that."
333,11,"So that could be another example of attentive listening, right? Yeah. Like what? Listening to each other and making sure that we're focusing on the people"
333,12,"That, sorry,"
333,13,"Emily, do you have any other ideas that go with attentive listening?"
333,14,"Ooh. Um, I think, you know, pay attention and not talking when someone else is talking."
333,15,"Right? Yeah. Those are both good parts of it. Hmm. Um hmm. So Will, what about you? Do you have any ideas?"
333,16,"Um, I, uh, oh, sorry. I'm just, oh, sorry about that. Just stayed up late last night. I'm sorry about that. Sorry. Um, yeah, uh, I think, I think, uh, what Emily said makes sense. Yeah."
333,17,And you reminded me
333,18,"What's my,"
333,19,Oh hey.
333,20,Okay.
333,21,"Will, you reminded me of the other to talk about, which is be respectful of other people and helping keep helping to take care of each"
333,22,Other.
333,23,"So one way that we could take care of each other was, well, since you were tired from school, um, from staying up late last night. Yeah. I know that you might be a little tired tonight and we can be sensitive to that."
333,24,"Yeah. What are some ways, sorry about that."
333,25,That's okay. What are some other ways we can look out for each other at school?
333,26,"Um,"
333,27,"Jayla, thanks for raising your hand. What, what was your idea?"
333,28,"Yeah, I think, I think, um, let's see, showing up on time is always good. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I think, you know, I'm being ready to work at the beginning of class, stuff like that."
333,29,"Yeah. That's another part of being respectful. Right. And that kind of goes with listening cuz you're coming, you're ready, you're ready to learn. You have all your materials."
333,30,"Yeah. Oh, I wanted to mention, you know, I, I finally got to see one of those Ironman movies I'd heard so much about. Um, I'm not so much into comics, but lemme tell you, I really enjoyed it. Um, I'm probably late, you know, late to the party, but mention to that folks, it's good stuff if you haven't seen it. So"
333,31,"That's very cool. Carlos. Um, can for now, can we talk about our norms and then later today when we break into small groups. Okay. I'd love to hear about the movie that you watched, cuz that sounds great."
333,32,Oh yeah. Yeah. That'll be fun. No problem. No problem.
333,33,"So Carlos, do you have any ideas about how we can take care of each other at school? How we can look out for each other? Hang on Emily, I'm gonna give Carlos a chance. Calling you."
333,34,"Okay. Um, I think, uh, maybe, oh, I don't know. Uh, maybe like not running in class. That be good. You know, just kind of being respectful of people's space."
333,35,"Yeah, that's a great idea. Being respectful of people's space, helping keep your body safe, other people's body safe. Um, that's a great one. Emily, what was your idea?"
333,36,"Um, I was gonna say like, uh, just be um, treat people the way you would wanna be treated. I think that'd be good."
333,37,"That is a great one. Right. So that's this idea of I wanna take, we wanna take care. Want to take care us"
333,38,"Today? No, we didn't have a book report due today. Oh. Uh, I'm sorry. I thought, I thought we had something due today, but I guess we don't. No, because it's the first day after vacation. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. Misunderstood. Okay."
333,39,"That's okay. So one way too will that I was thinking,"
333,40,"So this is um, boring. Why are we doing this? Why are we doing this? I'm sorry. I forgot why."
333,41,"Alright, hang on Jayla. So Will, like I was saying, um, we can kind of think about what our class is doing so we can keep each other on track. Maybe that could be a way that we take care of each other. Okay. Jayla, what were you saying?"
333,42,"Oh no, I was saying this is boring. I just didn't know why we were doing this. That's all."
333,43,"Yeah. It's a good way for us to regroup cuz I think sometimes when we've been at home for a long time, uh, we do things the way we do 'em at home."
333,44,All right. Well that is the end of your simulation.
334,0,"Uh, so it's time for your session to start and we will begin simulation."
334,1,Hi class. Did everyone have a great break?
334,2,"Oh, yeah. Oh yeah. How about you?"
334,3,"I had a great break. Excellent. And so now that we are back in the classroom, we should think about what are some ways that we show that we can be respectful to others in the classroom and also ourselves? What are, what could that look like? Raise your hand if you have an answer."
334,4,"Um, oh, sit up. I am sitting up. Nina. Nina paying attention. Oh, yep. Sorry. Getting, really paying attention. Sorry"
334,5,"About that. Yeah. Nina, I heard you talking, but I didn't see you Raise your hand. Do you have an idea to share about how we respectful to our classmates?"
334,6,"Oh, sure. Um, I think showing up on time is usually a good way to start up the day,"
334,7,"Showing up and being on time. Do we just show up however we want? We can just like run into the classroom. Oh, no. Do we do that?"
334,8,"Sorry, my mom is texting me. Oh, dear. Wonder, forgot something at home. I'm"
334,9,"Emily. One moment, Emily."
334,10,Sorry. Sorry about that. My mom was just texting me. <laugh>. Sorry. That's
334,11,"Okay. Remember, our phones are not out or we're having a discussion. Okay. Go ahead and put that away. Will I see you nodding? Do you have another idea?"
334,12,"So, how we, um, I, sorry. I'm sorry. I just, woo, just woke up. I just, uh, I I stayed up way too late last night. Oh, I'm sorry. Um, uh, whew. Too"
334,13,Much YouTube. I can also come back you if you want a moment to
334,14,"Make if you could. Yeah. No, but I'm awake now. I'm awake now. So, um, yeah. Uh, maybe no cell phones would be a good rule. I don't know."
334,15,"Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, that could be one way we show that we are being respectful to our"
334,16,"Jayla. Need to go. It should be fun. Oh, yep. I'm sorry. I was just telling, uh, Emily about a birthday party today. Sorry about that."
334,17,"Sorry. Yep. Jayla, do you have an idea of mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Some ways that we can be respectful to our peers. To our classmates?"
334,18,"Yeah. Um, I think letting one person talk at a time maybe is getting mm-hmm. <affirmative>, like, you know, hearing people's thoughts and being respectful of people's opinions and stuff."
334,19,"Oh yeah. So that we're listening when someone else is speaking and that means that we're not talking while someone else is speaking because if you're talking and you're trying to listen to someone talk, it's really hard to do more than one thing."
334,20,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.
334,21,Yep. Okay. Does anyone else have ideas of what it could look like to be respectful?
334,22,"Uh hmm. Oh, oh, I wanted to say, I finally got to see the first Ironman movie. I do know. I've never seen it, so I, I highly recommend Carlos to everybody. Um,"
334,23,"So excited that, can you tell me about that after we have our discussion?"
334,24,"Okay, I can do that. Not a problem. Right? Beth? A problem."
334,25,"Sounds great. Do you have any ideas for how we can be responsible to our classmates? If not, I can come back to you."
334,26,"Oh, no, no. I, I can, uh, I think, uh, maybe we said showing up on time. I think, uh, I guess, you know, always being prepared and ready to work, you know, like having your homework done and your reading and stuff, so mm-hmm. <affirmative> every day."
334,27,"Yeah. So having your homework done, having done your readings, maybe showing up, maybe you have all your materials ready. Emily, what do you think?"
334,28,"Um, I think a good one would be like being respectful of space, you know, like, um, not running or touching other people's stuff if it's not yours, things like that."
334,29,Yeah. And that could be dangerous sometimes.
334,30,"Oh. Did we have a book report? No. Well, we didn't. I thought we had a book report too."
334,31,"Will, do you have a question?"
334,32,"Yes. Oh, I, I, I just, uh, I thought that there was, um, I thought there was a book report due today, but I guess, I guess I was mistaken I guess since it was vacation we didn't have like, any assignments and stuff, so. Yep. That's ok. Sorry, I was just nervous. I might have missed something <laugh>."
334,33,"Sorry. And that's okay. But we'll talk about that later, will. Okay."
334,34,Okay. Okay.
334,35,"Any other ideas? So I heard we were gonna come to class prepared. Yeah, we're gonna homework done."
334,36,"This is, this is boring. Um, why, why are we doing this again? I'm sorry."
334,37,"Because sometimes when we're gone for a really long time, it's hard to remember the things that we're used to doing and things that are normal. Yep."
334,38,I get it. I'm sorry. Just checking. Cool. Yeah.
334,39,All right. Other ideas or other classroom norms that you guys remember from Hmm. Before the break.
334,40,"Alright, well, hey, you, uh, are done with that simulation, so thank you for completing."
335,0,"Uh, it is time for your session to start, so we will"
335,1,"Begin simulations. Oh, hi there."
335,2,"Oh, hi. Hello everybody."
335,3,Hi. How's
335,4,"Everyone? Hi there. How, how are y'all doing? Uh, since we've, uh, just from our break."
335,5,"Yes. Yes. Oh, doing good. Did you have a good break?"
335,6,"Uh, it was okay. It was okay, if I'm being honest."
335,7,Good.
335,8,"<laugh>. I heard Carlos. So how was, how was your, uh, how was your holiday, if you don't mind sharing?"
335,9,"Oh, it was all right. It's all right. I enjoyed myself. Oh, one second. You should sit up straight. I am sitting up straight. What do you mean? No, you just look like you're not paying attention. I'm paying attention. Well,"
335,10,"Oh, hi, Nina. And Will, uh,"
335,11,"Oh, I'm sorry. I was just trying to get Will to pay attention. Sometimes he can"
335,12,"Go to sleep. Oh, I see that. I really appreciate that you were really being thoughtful about, you know, the people sitting next to you, but it sounds like Thank you. Will says he, he is paying attention, so let's, let's trust him when he says that. But I do appreciate that you are trying to make sure that he was, you know, paying attention. Appreciate that. Anyone else? I'm sorry. Oh,"
335,13,"Yes. I just got a phone call. I'm sorry. My mom just, um, oh dear. I think I left something at home. Would you like to something? Sorry. I'm sorry. Stop it."
335,14,"No, no worries. Emily, if there's something, uh, wrong, would you like to, uh, go speak to a counselor maybe about what's going"
335,15,"On? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. I just left my lunch, um, at home and my mom is just texting me. No big deal. No big deal."
335,16,"Oh, okay. Cool. Cool, cool. Sounds like you're taking care of it. Yeah. Uh, would anyone like to share how their, uh, their holiday was, looks like? Will probably had maybe a, a very tiresome, uh, holiday. <laugh>. Oh,"
335,17,"<laugh>. Oh, sorry. Was there a lot going on? I just, I think I went to The Bahamas for a moment. No, I was up just watching movies. Just watching movies. That's all right. I'm sorry. Sorry about that. Yeah,"
335,18,"I, I have watched some movies this, uh, this past holiday too, too. Me Too. Would be a real great way to,"
335,19,"Uh,"
335,20,Enjoy your holiday.
335,21,"Oh, cool. Should be."
335,22,"Oh, Jayla. I'm afraid I missed that. Were you, uh, is that something you"
335,23,"Wanted? I was just, um, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. I was just, I was just talking to Emily about, um, birthday party later on, I guess there's a, uh, there's one at a trampoline park, which should be pretty cool. Said we were just,"
335,24,Oh my
335,25,"Gosh, later on. Yeah. A big deal. Oh, yeah. It should be fun. This place called Jump. It's here in town. That sounds"
335,26,Wonderful.
335,27,"Oh, yeah. Wow."
335,28,"Sounds fun. Everyone's really has a lot, a lot going on either, you know, the past couple days or coming up, uh mm-hmm. <affirmative> and I mean mm-hmm. <affirmative>, that's, I mean, that's just really wonderful. I'm so excited that everyone's, you know, ha has a lot of fun stuff going on. Emily, uh, would you like to, uh, share? Is there anything that you had, uh, in the past, uh, couple days or something coming up you're looking forward to?"
335,29,"Um, well, no, nothing really. I'm just happy to be back, you know, <laugh> Thanksgiving and stuff. It should be fun, you know?"
335,30,Yeah.
335,31,"I feel, you know what, I did wanna mention something, you know, I finally got around to seeing that, uh, what is it, Ironman movies. I, I'm not really so much in comic books, but, but, but I, I watched it and I am hooked, you know, that Robert Don Jr. Is something. So, uh, but yeah, just, just a little, little movie review for y'all, that's all."
335,32,"Yeah. Uh, so it sounds like, uh, some other folks, uh, we're watching movies, uh, too. Will, uh, Nina, I'm curious, would you like to share anything, uh, from the, the past, uh, couple days in the holiday or what you might have coming up that you're excited about? Oh,"
335,33,"Um, well, uh, I think, um, you know, we're gonna get a new cat at our house, so that should be fun. Oh"
335,34,My gosh. Is there a name?
335,35,"Yeah, it should be fun out at the end. You mean to say that's what's going on with this?"
335,36,"No. Yeah. You'll have to tell us if, if you come up with a name. Oh my gosh. Well, before we go on, something I wanna talk about is Nina,"
335,37,"Uh, Nina. Did I forget my book report? Do we have a book report due today?"
335,38,"Oh, will"
335,39,Have a book report.
335,40,"Very, very important that you're thinking about your book"
335,41,"Report. Yeah. I just forgot, I, I thought I forgot something. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
335,42,"Oh, no worries. No worries. Why, why don't you write that down, or, you know what? I'll even write it down. Okay. Uh, Will's book report, and we'll see if we can't check on that later. Cause there's something really, really important I'd like to talk about with y'all. Um, so as we're coming back, I just wanna make sure that we all remember some of the classroom norm set up. Oh, Jayla. Yes."
335,43,"Gotcha. I, I just had a question. This is, uh, please. It's kinda boring. Why are we, why are we doing this?"
335,44,"Oh, why are we talking about classroom norms? That's a really good question. Yeah. And you know what? I think that's a really good point. A lot of us might think it's kind of boring to talk about classroom norms. We've already talked about it before the beginning of the year, so it's like, why do we need to talk about this again? Well, I think for some people, you know, maybe they've forgotten about it or, oh, oh, hey, there."
336,0,Simulation. Hi. Hi. Hello. How was your vacation?
336,1,Mine was good. How was you guys?
336,2,"It was all, it was. Alright. You had a good time."
336,3,What did everybody do?
336,4,"Oh, I just hung out with, uh, and, uh, yeah, he's watched some watch some movies. It was good."
336,5,Awesome. What else? Did anybody else do? Anything fun?
336,6,"Uh, well, you know, uh, my dad is a beekeeper and, uh, I love bees, so he really like taught me how to, uh, you know, work with the bees. I used to be pretty scared of it, but here we are. Pretty cool. Nice."
336,7,"Okay, so I wanna go over some stuff that we may have forgotten while"
336,8,We're gone sitting here. Yeah. But you're slouching in your seat. Pay attention. Okay. Sorry.
336,9,"Hi. Okay, back up. Your eyes on. Okay. Okay. So I wanna go over some strategies that we're gonna talk about today, about what we're gonna do when we're listening to teacher and how we can be respectful in the classroom. Does that sound cool?"
336,10,"Ok. Yeah. I'm sorry. My mom is, um, sending me a text. I'm sorry. I must have left something at home. I'm sorry."
336,11,"I'm sorry. It's okay. It's all good. So remember guys, I want you to remember to raise your hands when you have something to say. Can we all do that?"
336,12,"Oh, yeah. Okay."
336,13,Awesome. Next thing we wanna do is stay seated when mm-hmm. <affirmative> teacher is talking and when teacher is giving a lesson. Is that understood?
336,14,Yeah.
336,15,"Awesome. Um, I want you to be respectful towards your classmates. Mm. Hello? Will. Are we all alright?"
336,16,"Oh, oh, oh, no, I'm fine. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Whoa, sorry. I just, you're okay. We're cat there. Oh, man, I, I watched too many, uh, too many cartoons last night. <laugh>. Sorry."
336,17,"Sorry. We've all I, you guys"
336,18,All right. Party later?
336,19,"Yeah. So I'm gonna, you, you guys to be quiet when teacher is talking that way you guys"
336,20,"Can, sorry, repeat"
336,21,That I'm saying. Okay.
336,22,Okay. Sorry.
336,23,"All good. And then, let's see, remember to, um, we're gonna ask to use the restroom if we need to, and I want you guys to just follow my directions."
336,24,"Okay? Oh,"
336,25,"Yes, Jayla."
336,26,"Um, I have a good, like, classroom norm. Maybe we give you, um, maybe like everybody shows up prepared and like, ready to work, you don't have your homework done, and, uh, stuff like that, you know, so we're all ready to kind of start off on the same page."
336,27,"Yes. That's a great one. That's a great, thank you. Cool. Let's see, another norm. Let's make sure we also, um, have all of our materials ready in front of us. That way we don't have to get up and around the room."
336,28,"Oh, oh, I wanted to mention in, I finally got to see the first Ironman movie, which, which I just never got around to it and I just thought it was awesome. I don't know if anybody else did, but I just wanna put that out there. Yeah. So, cool. Thank"
336,29,"You for sharing. Carlos. I wanna say No problem, problem to raise your hand if you have anything else you wanna share or if you have any questions. Okay."
336,30,"Yes. Oh, yes, of course. I'm sorry, I forgot. Sorry about that. That's okay. Gotcha."
336,31,Okay. I think there some other classroom norms. Does anybody else have any classroom norms they wanna add to my list?
336,32,"I do,"
336,33,"I do. Ok, Anna?"
336,34,"Um, I think it's important to, you know, be respectful of people's space and like, you know, don't touch things that are yours, Stevie, no running or, or pushing or just be respectful of for those students. I think"
336,35,"That is a great classroom Norm, does everybody understand what Emily's trying to say?"
336,36,"Oh yeah. No, I totally do. Oh, Mina did, did we have a anything to today? Good book report? No. Well, is that first day after vacation"
336,37,"About a, um, classroom norm you think would be okay?"
336,38,"Oh, you know what, I was just talking to Mina because I was worried that I, like we had an assignment. Do we have anything to do today? I, I, for some reason, maybe it's when I fell asleep before, I thought we had a book record or something. <laugh>."
336,39,I don't
336,40,Remember. Okay. I'm slow today. <laugh>. Okay. That is ok. Sorry about that.
336,41,Hmm.
336,42,Let see. This is boring. Why are we doing this?
336,43,"Oh, yes, we wanna do this because it's just a reminder of the rules that that way we can all be healthy and happy students. That way we can learn to our, our best experience and everything like that."
336,44,"Gotcha. No problem. Sounds good. Oh, um, oh, norm?"
336,45,"Yes, Jayla."
336,46,"Thank you. Yeah, so maybe we could, um, I don't know. It could."
336,47,"Alright, well that was abrupt, but thank you, uh, for completing your simulation."
337,0,"To start. So we will, uh, begin simulation."
337,1,Hi everyone. Welcome back. Hope everyone had a great today.
337,2,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's"
337,3,"Be good. All right. So let's quickly go over some of our norms that we used before we, or before we had our vacation. Remember. So, when we come into the classroom, when we unpack, we wanna go straight to our cubies to put away our backpacks, and then we wanna wash our hands and unstack our chairs and eat our breakfast before morning announcements. Right?"
337,4,Hi. Well sit up. I'm sitting up you talking? Yep. Not paying attention.
337,5,"All right. Nina. Paying, paying attention. Let's worry about ourselves. All right. Okay. Okay."
337,6,Okay. Check.
337,7,"And for morning meeting, remember, um, I would like if everyone could move their chairs silently to the circle and just sit there, wait for everyone to get into our morning meeting circle, and then we'll begin. All right. So what it looks like and sounds like it should be silent in our chairs. Okay. Oh, dear."
337,8,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My mom is, my mom is texting me. Sorry. <laugh>, she's, I think I forgot something at home. Sorry."
337,9,"All right, Emily, let's turn off our phones and put it away in our backpack's. Okay. We don't read it at"
337,10,Our desks. I just did. Gotcha. Sorry. Gotcha.
337,11,"Okay. And when we, after morning meeting, when we get into our language arts and content writing, right. For independent work. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, remember, we want to do our best to ignore distractions and prevent distractions. Well, what else do we need to do?"
337,12,"Yeah. Oh, oh, yeah. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I, I, I <laugh>, I think I stayed up too late last night. I'm sorry. What was the, what was the, what were you saying? I'm"
337,13,"Sorry. So, when we're working independently, besides ignoring and preventing distractions, what else do we need to do? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>,"
337,14,"Um, focus on our, on our work, I guess."
337,15,"Yes. We want to try our best and work independently on our own work. All right. Jayla, you could also give us an example of what it's, what we're supposed to do during your independent work."
337,16,"Um, well, I think you said focus on your work, but also, um, if you have any questions, uh, to ask, you know, if you, if you're not understanding something"
337,17,"Exactly. So we wanna silently raise our hands so that signals to the, uh, to me that you need help and I'll come over to you as soon as I can. Right. And then number s we use our, um, index finger and our middle finger to cross them. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, so that signals that you need to use a bathroom. All right. Okay. Carlos, do you want to add anything Yes. To independent work looks like in South"
337,18,"Wales? Well, you know, I was just gonna say, um, you know, over the weekend I finally got to see the first Ironman in movies, and I thought it was Ironman movie rather. And it was really cool. That's all. I just wanted a, uh, I don't know if anyone's a fan. I'm not much of a fan, but, uh, I'm looked, so it's pretty cool."
337,19,Thank you for sharing. But let's hold that off until morning meetings share. Okay.
337,20,"Okay. Okay. Sure, sure, sure."
337,21,"All right, Tina, how about you? Would you like to add anything? Oh, yes. Emily, was that a signal from the bathroom? Yes. All right."
337,22,"Oh, no, no, no, no. I was just, just gonna add a, um, a norm. Um, I was gonna say that, you know, being respectful of people's space is good and like Yes. Maybe not running, or, um, you know, being disrespectful of other people in their space, so,"
337,23,"Yep. Exactly. We want to respect our space, our, our peers, our friend's space, and our school space. Right. We wanna make sure everyone is safe. Oh,"
337,24,Did we have anything due today?
337,25,"Well, let's, we can talk about that later. Okay."
337,26,Okay. Alright. Sorry.
337,27,"Ask our norms. All right. And Nina, can you tell what, um, tell us what it looks like and sounds like when we walk in the school hallway when we go to specials."
337,28,"Um, I think it probably wanna be quiet and pay attention to like, or get ready for what we're about to do."
337,29,Yep. And we wanna make sure we give our friends in front of us and behind us some. Right.
337,30,Boring. Yeah. This is boring. Why are we doing this?
337,31,"I know it can be a little boring sometimes, Jayla, but when we come back from vacation, since she's had a long break from school, we wanna make sure that everyone remembers the school norms and classroom norms before we get started. Okay. That way we can get right back into our routine."
337,32,That makes sense. That makes sense. I hear that. Okay.
338,0,Begin simulation.
338,1,Hi guys. Welcome back from break.
338,2,"Hello. Uh,"
338,3,"Today we're just gonna be reviewing some of our classroom norms, okay. So we can remember how we are supposed to behave in our classroom. Alright, right?"
338,4,<inaudible>?
338,5,"Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, so our two big norms that we need to follow, um, the first is to be respectful and our second one is to be diligent. Um, so does anybody want to tell me a little bit about how we can be respectful in the classroom?"
338,6,"Um, well sit up. What? I'm sitting here. I'm just, just not paying attention. Hey, attention. I'm okay. Okay."
338,7,"Thank you, Mina. Okay. Um, yes. So Mina, would you like to share it with us a little bit about how you can be respectful in the classroom?"
338,8,"Um, sure. Uh, I always be, I prepared, um, to do your work every day. No."
338,9,Okay. Yeah. Okay. So you can be prepared to go to class. Good. Anybody else?
338,10,"Oops, sorry. Sorry, my mom is, uh, texting me. I'm sorry. Sorry about that. I think I left something at home."
338,11,"Oh, okay. Emily, do you need to step out to talk to your mom? You can go to the office to call."
338,12,"No, no, I can, I can just text her. I text her later."
338,13,"Okay. Yeah, that's good. If it's not urgent, let's text her later or we can go to the office and call her. Thank you. Would, do you have any ideas about how we can be respectful in the classroom?"
338,14,"Um, well, I guess, you know, having, uh, homework done and like being ready to work every day. I guess you already said that. Uh, maybe respectful other people maybe."
338,15,"Yeah. Yes. Being respectful of other people. That's good. Um, so listening to them will, what do you think? Do you think, uh, sleeping while others are talking is being"
338,16,"Oh no. Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh, I stayed up too late last night. Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry. I definitely shouldn't sleep in class, so That's great. I agree with you there."
338,17,"Yeah. So that's good. So that's all about also being prepared for class. Right. Birthday party. So getting our work done. Well. All right, let's move on to be diligent. Jayla, do you have any ideas about how we can be diligent in the classroom?"
338,18,"Um, yeah, I guess like, no, uh, side conversations and stuff."
338,19,"Okay. Yes. Yes. So no side conversations being focused on our work. Carlos is doing a really good job. He's being a, um, great example for how to be respectful in the classroom. He's being very attentive, um, to what I'm saying and to what you guys are saying. So thank you Carlos. You're being, Hey,"
338,20,No problem.
338,21,Does anybody have any other norms that they think would be helpful in our classroom? We have our main two be respectful and be diligent. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But do you guys have any other that you think would be helpful for us?
338,22,"Uh hmm. Oh, oh, you know, I was gonna say, I finally got to see the first Ironman movie, uh, over the weekend. It was really cool. Um, so just wanted to put that out there. I don't know if that's a rule, but, um, it should be a rule that everyone should see it."
338,23,Okay. That's cool. Did you learn anything from the movie that could help us in class? Maybe
338,24,"Any? Um, well, yeah, I don't, I don't know <laugh>, I don't know if Iron Ironman has much, uh, you know, transferable skills, uh, for, for the classroom, but, um, okay. Yeah."
338,25,"Well, thank you for sharing. Yeah. Maybe we can talk about that a little later during a free time or something. Thanks for sharing. Yes. Emily, you have any ideas?"
338,26,"Yeah, um, I think, you know, being respectful of people's space. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you know, not running or taking things that aren't yours. Um, things like that,"
338,27,If that makes sense. Very nice. Yes. That sounds great. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Yes. Being mindful of what other people have going on and of their things also. Thanks
338,28,"Nina. Did we have anything do today? No. Well, first day back vacation?"
338,29,Yes. First day after on vacation. You sure? We don't have anything do will.
338,30,"Oh, no. Okay. Good"
338,31,Checking though. Yeah. Okay.
338,32,"Okay. <laugh>. I was worried cuz you know, never know. Um,"
338,33,"No, that's good. That's all part of being diligent. So if you have a question about things that might be due, you can raise your hand and we can talk about that a little later. Okay?"
338,34,Okay.
338,35,"Thank you. Thank you for checking. Thank you for being diligent. Yeah. Alright. Um, yes, this"
338,36,Is boring. Why are we doing this?
338,37,"Yeah. Okay. So it's just really important that when we come back from a break, that we just kind of remind ourselves how we are supposed to act in the classroom. Uhhuh, <affirmative>. So I know it's probably not like the exciting activity, but it is super important. Makes sense. It'll make, it'll make our activities more fun later down the road because everybody will be able to function properly. Does that make sense?"
338,38,"Cool. Oh no, that totally makes sense. I was just checking."
338,39,"Oh, thank you."
338,40,Awesome.
338,41,That's important that we talk about how we feel. So thanks for sharing Jayla.
339,0,"Session to begin. Uh, so begin simulation."
339,1,Alright. Hello class. How's everybody doing today?
339,2,Doing good. How are you?
339,3,"I'm doing well, thank you. I hope you enjoyed your break. Good. So, yeah. Uh, since this is our first day back, let's just go over some expectations first. Uh, so that we established at the beginning of the year. So my, our first one is to listen respectfully, to actively listen. Can anybody give me an example of actively listening?"
339,4,"Uh, yeah, like, you know, facing forward and, and listening to, uh, the teacher or whoever's talking"
339,5,"Yeah, great. Whoever's talking. That's a good point. So, yeah,"
339,6,Sit up.
339,7,What
339,8,"Can, I'm sitting up what"
339,9,"You're talking about. Let's practice our active listening and, yeah. Okay. So thank you Mina. So yeah, one thing about active listening is that we have our eyes on the speaker and we have our mouse closed and we are really thinking about what the speaker is saying. And Carlos, I really like that point. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> about how you have to, like, it can go with a peer or with a teacher. Yes. Emily, do you have anything there?"
339,10,"I'm sorry. Um, I'm sorry. My mom is texting me. I guess I forgot something at home or, oh, here. Okay. Okay. Sorry."
339,11,"So I'll let you, uh, we can handle that later now since we're having our discussion."
339,12,"Oh, I'll put it away. Active"
339,13,"Listening. Thank you, Emily. All right."
339,14,"Sure, sure. I'm sorry."
339,15,"Thank you, Emily. I appreciate it. So now let's go on to our next expectation is to be safe with our bodies. Can anybody, uh, gimme an example or tell me more about that? Will do you"
339,16,"Have, I think it's like, oh, um,"
339,17,I'm sorry.
339,18,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, whoa. I'm sorry. <laugh>. Sorry I stayed up way too late last night. Um, what was the question? I'm sorry."
339,19,"Yeah. Uh, do you have any, uh, example or anything you can share about being safe with our bodies?"
339,20,"Oh, yeah. Um, don't run. I think, you know, not, not running is important, you know? Yeah. Be respectful of like, other people's space,"
339,21,"Right? Yeah. Good job saying, being respectful of other people's space. We"
339,22,Wanna come to the birthday party lady.
339,23,"Yeah. Be careful. Oh, Jayla. Jayla and Emily. Make sure we're practicing."
339,24,"Oh, I'm sorry. All right. Gotcha. Sorry about that. Sorry. Gotcha."
339,25,"Thank you. I'm gonna call on one of you next to share another expectation, but will, yeah, I definitely like that. Being safe with our bodies, walking, not running, and yeah, just being mindful of other people's space. All right. Um, so our third expectation I wanna go over is try our hardest and do our best work. Jayla, do you have anything to share"
339,26,"About that? Oh, I was gonna, I was gonna suggest, um, you know, showing up on time and just being ready to work, having your homework done, or you, or your reading done and just kind of being ready to, um, jump in."
339,27,"Yeah. Great. Jenna, thank you for sharing it. And I was gonna go over that. So yeah, that's definitely a good example of being responsible and being on top of everything. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Great. Right? So go to our next, our other expectation to try our hardest and do our best. Oh, can you give an example?"
339,28,"Oh, I wanted to mention, you know, I finally got to see the first, uh, Ironman movie over the weekend and it was, it was great. Uh, I don't anyone's seen it"
339,29,"More about that later, Carlos, but let's give, give em Emily a chance of Sarah."
339,30,Okay. Thank you.
339,31,Okay. Alright. Emily. So an example of trying our hardest. Yeah.
339,32,"You know, I was gonna say, um, you know, be respectful of like people's things. Like, um, you know, if you, you know, I wouldn't take like Carlos's pen or he wouldn't take something that's mine without asking, you know, just be respectful of people's belongings maybe."
339,33,"Yeah. Right. That is definitely one thing we wanna focus on being respectful. I think that goes back to what Will was saying, but can you think of an example of trying your hardest and doing your best to work? How, what would that look like?"
339,34,"Oh, um, oh, it's like participating and like being a part of the discussion maybe? No, yeah."
339,35,"Right. Participating and really have focus and trying to do is the best you can. Oh, well, no, make sure we're practicing our active listening. Will Amina"
339,36,"Oh yeah, I'm sorry. I was asking if we had anything due today, but I, I guess we don't cause it's okay."
339,37,Communication.
339,38,Another <laugh>.
339,39,"Yeah. Well, so yeah. That, that definitely could be a concern of yours, but make sure we are mm-hmm. <affirmative> doing our active listening during this discussion. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, that goes with being respectful as well, so thank you, Mina. All right. This"
339,40,Is boring. Why are we doing this again?
339,41,"Why this is, I think this is very important, Jayla, because, so we okay. Can, we can just stop back from break. So this is good to go over so we can, um, yeah. Be set for these next few weeks and really do our best work and stay on track. All right."
339,42,Okay. I understand. That makes sense. Sorry about that
339,43,"Part of this discussions Jay. Alright. So any other expectations anybody would like to uh, mention that we established of Canadian"
339,44,End.
340,0,Begin simulation.
340,1,Hello everyone.
340,2,Hey Nick.
340,3,How are you guys doing?
340,4,Doing good. How are you?
340,5,"Good. Um, okay, so today we are going to talk about our class norms. Again, if you remember, we talked about this at the beginning of the school year, but we're gonna go over it again today, okay? Okay. So our first, um, class norm is that we are going to be respectful. Nice. So that means being respectful"
340,6,Of
340,7,"The teacher, of others and yourself. Nina, can you come up with an example of what it means to be respectful to other people?"
340,8,"Yes. Um, I think when everyone like listens and someone's talking. So listen to the person that's"
340,9,Talking. Exactly. If you're listening while someone's talking. Does that mean that you're chatting with your friend?
340,10,"Oh, no, not at all. No,"
340,11,"No, exactly. Okay. Thank you so much. Mina. Um, who can give me an example of being respectful to the teacher?"
340,12,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My mom is texting me. Me? I think I forgot something at home. I'm sorry. Oh,"
340,13,"Okay. This is a good example, guys. Do we think that texting during class is being respectful to the teacher?"
340,14,No.
340,15,"No? No. When is a good time to text? Thank you. Thank you. Emily, when is a good time to text? When would be a good time to check your phone, see what your friends are up to? What do y'all think? I think"
340,16,"After class, you know, in between Yeah. When we're not in school or when we're not, like, busy with us."
340,17,"Okay. Yeah, that's great. Um, okay, will, how are you feeling?"
340,18,"Oh, no. Oh, I'm sorry. I stayed up too late last night. I'm sorry. I'm awake now. That's"
340,19,"Okay. It happened to all of us, but I"
340,20,Have question
340,21,"You, um, what does it mean to be respectful at a school property?"
340,22,"Um, to, you know, uh, take care of things and, and, and stuff?"
340,23,Yeah. Give me an example.
340,24,"Oh. Oh, Emily, you, are you gonna go to the trampoline park lady? Yes. Is it birthday? Is it, is it mine?"
340,25,"Will, what about if you're throwing pencils? Is that respectful to school friends?"
340,26,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't please. No, no. Throwing pencils. Yeah. Yeah. Not a good call. So, yeah, we're gonna have a, um, meeting. Yeah. CRI meeting."
340,27,"Okay. And so that was our first norm, right? Be respectful. Our second one is to be kind. I'm sure you all know what that means. You guys have been talking about that since kindergarten, right? Mm."
340,28,Mm-hmm.
340,29,"<affirmative>. Yeah. Um, okay. And then our third norm is to try your best in class. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. What's up, Jayla?"
340,30,"Oh, yeah, I was gonna sing one. Um, okay. I think, uh, showing up on time, like being ready to work, you know, at the beginning of class. Yeah, that's a good"
340,31,"One. That's a great one. Oh,"
340,32,"Oh, I, you know what I wanted to mention? I finally got to see, uh, that first Ironman movie and Wow. It was so good. I, I'm not into the, you know, superhero staff, but, but, but folks, it was terrific."
340,33,"So, really? Okay. I had, but I do wanna ask you more about it after this conversation. Okay. Okay."
340,34,Out. Cool. Sounds
340,35,"Good. Yeah, I'll ask you. Cool. Um, does anybody else have another class norm that we haven't talked about that you wanna add to the list? Emily?"
340,36,"Um, maybe like, Hmm. Well, you said the thing about throwing pencils. I was gonna say like, no running, um, like don't touch things that aren't yours unless you ask, or, or whatever. So just be like, respectful of space and other people's space too. Uhhuh."
340,37,"<affirmative>. Yeah. Yeah. How do you think someone would feel if they started, uh, using your stuff without,"
340,38,Was anything due today?
340,39,"No. Will do. I, what you talking"
340,40,About? I'm sorry.
340,41,"You wanna answer this question? I think you're ready to talk. All right. Uh, the question is, if someone else is touching your stuff and you didn't Yeah."
340,42,"Um,"
340,43,"Give them permission to, how do you think you would feel?"
340,44,"I would not be happy. No, not at all."
340,45,"Okay. Yeah, yeah. Awesome."
340,46,This
340,47,"Is,"
340,48,This is boring. Why are we doing this?
340,49,"Did you already know all the, all the norms? You didn't forget them?"
340,50,"Oh, no, I was just, I was just curious why we were doing it. That's all. Okay."
340,51,"Well, the reason why I'm doing this is you might already know then. I'm sure you do, but I wanna do this so I can set my expectations so you guys know exactly what is expected. And then if I tell you something like, Hey, remember we were gonna be respectful to the teacher or something, then there we go."
341,0,It is time for your session to start. So begin simulation.
341,1,"Good morning class. I hope you all had a great vacation. Today we are going to review some classroom norms. So first I'm going to go over a few norms that I think would be good for the group. And I would like your feedback too, because they're not only my norms, they're also your norms, right? And then at the end, okay, if anyone has any suggestions for norms, you can share those with me too. Does that sound good? Okay. Yeah,"
341,2,Sounds great.
341,3,"Okay, so the first norm that I have is to respect yourself. Sit up others and those around you."
341,4,I'm sitting
341,5,"Up, Nina, I'm"
341,6,"Sitting up. Yeah, I'm sorry. Just, just thought will, wasn't paying, paying attention."
341,7,So can you tell me the norm that I just went over?
341,8,"Um, to be respectful. I didn't quite hear you. Sorry."
341,9,Yes. I said to respect yourself and others. And do you think that it's very respectful of space when you tell him what to do in a mean tone or mean way?
341,10,"No, no, no. Not at all. Sorry"
341,11,"About that. It's not So that, that, sorry. That action that you just did doesn't really align with our norm that we were going over. Emily."
341,12,"Sorry, my mom is texting me. I think I got something at home. Sorry."
341,13,Are you nervous?
341,14,"Is it Oh, no, no, no, no."
341,15,It's an important phone call.
341,16,"No, it was just"
341,17,"Something to talk to your mom. But if, yeah, it's, something's not really important right now. We need to focus on our norms because the idea of a norm is for us to be able to come to the classroom together to be able to learn. And if you're texting your mom, you're not really present in the moment or being able to learn with us in the moment. And learning these norms are really important for us to know how to interact with each other. Okay? Okay. Will, are you okay?"
341,18,"Whoa, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I, I dozed off. I, I I think I stayed up too late last night. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm here. I'm"
341,19,"Awake. I understand being tired in class can be hard, but remember we're trying to respect"
341,20,Come
341,21,"Yourself and others and that also birthday for me as your teacher, Jayla."
341,22,"Oh, sorry. I was just asking Emily if she was uh, gonna do something later. That's alright. Sorry, I'm here."
341,23,"Can you wait for your conversations to end when we're done with the norms? So I invited you all to be able to speak with me about the norms. So that means if you have something to say, you should say it to the entire group, not just a few people. Yes, Jayla."
341,24,"Okay. So, um, definitely I agree and, um, I have a, a norm to share, I guess like, you know, being, being, um, ready to go at the beginning of every class, like having done your homework and your reading and just kind of being ready to participate. So"
341,25,"Yes, I agree. I think that's a great norm. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, it kind of aligns with one of the norms that I wrote down for us"
341,26,Was
341,27,"Dare yourself to try. So that means that you try and give your best effort, like you were just saying, Carlos. Yeah. Are you okay?"
341,28,"I was gonna say, you know, I finally got around to seeing the first Ironman movie over the weekend and it was really great Carlos. Um, I don't know if anyone was into it, but"
341,29,"It's great. So what was, so Jay's norm that she just went over was about being prepared for class? Yeah. And do you think Ironman's really preparing you for class right now?"
341,30,"Um, I guess not. I guess I was just, you know, looking to share something, that's all. Yeah. So I'll stop. Gotcha."
341,31,"Okay, perfect. So now we're gonna go on to our next norm. So, so far we have to, to be prepared for class and we have to respect yourself, others, and the school. And then our next norm is going to be actively engaged and listen to one another and actively engage and listen to the teacher. So that means like for example, when Jla was just talking about her norm that she had Mina, we all listen to each other. Will do"
341,32,"Today? No. Oh, I'm sorry. I was just asking Mina if we had anything due today, but then I just remembered that, um, we're just coming back to vacation, so my bad."
341,33,"Sorry. Yes, I understand coming back from vacation can be kind of difficult. That's why we're going over these norms. But if you have a question about if there's something due, you can always ask me or it's up on our assignment sheet on the board. Okay."
341,34,"Okay. Sure, sure. Sorry about that."
341,35,"It's okay. So next,"
341,36,This is boring. Why are we doing this? Why are we doing this?
341,37,"So remember, our norms are for us to be able to interact with each other and have the best classroom environment that we can have. So I understand it may be a little boring to go over the norms, but our norms are really important because things like respect for each other and coming prepared for class are going to ensure that we have the best time in class that we can while we're together. So we have to go over our norm. Makes sense? People have different norms."
341,38,End.
342,0,So begin simulation.
342,1,"Welcome back class. Give me a thumb scale for how you are doing today. So a thumbs up is I am having a fantastic day. This might be the best day ever. Thumbs down is this is not a good day for me. So you can do anywhere in between. So gimme a thumb scale with where you're at. So,"
342,2,"Um, just one quick thing. We're unable to do a thumbs up, but we can nod our heads."
342,3,So here. Okay.
342,4,In move. That
342,5,Sounds good. Let's do
342,6,Awesome.
342,7,"Nod your head if you're feeling ready to be back in school today. Yeah,"
342,8,Go.
342,9,"Oh, awesome. Good. Well, welcome back to class. It's so good to see each one of you. I missed you over break. Um, to just kind of get back into the rhythm of class, we are going to go over our classroom norms. All right."
342,10,I'm sitting
342,11,"Actually first let's, so yes, let's go over our classroom norms first. So the first classroom norm is to be respectful. So we talked about this at the beginning of the year, <laugh>, something you can do to be respectful or to use your kind words to your classmates and to me to listen to one another when another person is speaking. So if I'm speaking, having your eyes on me or showing me in some way that you're listening."
342,12,"Yes. And sorry,"
342,13,The next classroom norm is to be safe. So this one is really important.
342,14,Sorry.
342,15,"Yeah. So being safe means to use your tools in your, at your desk. And, um, does anybody else have any ideas of another thing that you could do to be safe? Anything that we've talked about will, do you have anything to share? Any, any ideas of what can be"
342,16,"Be, oh, I'm sorry. Oh, that's ok. Oh, I'm sorry. I, I was, I stayed up way too late last night. I apologize. Oh yeah,"
342,17,It's hard. Back
342,18,"I's, oh dear. Do you have anything? Sorry,"
342,19,"Will, that might be a good thing to be, to, to remind the class of how we could be safe in the classroom."
342,20,"Jayla, are you gonna go to the tra party lady? Oh yeah, definitely. I'm definitely gonna go. It"
342,21,"Should be fun. If not, that's totally fine. Just let me know. You wanna pass?"
342,22,"Well, no, I was just, I'm sorry I got distracted. No, no. I think it's important to like, show up on time and, uh, yeah. And be ready to work every day, you know?"
342,23,"Yeah. That actually goes really well with my, our, our next classroom norm. Read, ready to learn. So showing up, up on time is a good one to be ready to learn and eyes up at the front kind of finding things that you're interested in while we're learning. Those are also really good things to be ready to learn. All right. Yes, Jay?"
342,24,"Oh, I was thinking a good one. Um, would be, you know, no texting or like, you know, messing around on your phone. Uh, yeah. You know, while school's going on."
342,25,"That's, that's fantastic. Thank you for sharing Jayla. Yeah. So when we are in the classroom, we're focusing on what we're learning rather than focusing on things that are outside the class, which is like on our Exactly. Great, thank you for sharing that."
342,26,I wanted to
342,27,"Examples of being safed. Just a second. Anybody else have any more examples of either being respectful, being safe, or being ready to learn?"
342,28,"I saw the first Ironman movie, um, this weekend, which was really awesome. So"
342,29,"That's cool. Chelsea, we're gonna get to a chance for you to share about what you did over break in just a moment. So we're gonna Okay, gotcha. Just a little bit, but yeah, that's good. Okay. Emily, do you have something?"
342,30,"Yes. Um, I dunno if you said this, but maybe if I, um, to be respectful of people's space, you know, and like not running or touching people's things that aren't yours and, you know. Yeah. Just being respectful of space. Yeah."
342,31,"Good. Yes, that's exactly, that's exactly what we wanna talk about. So being respectful of people's face, that means not getting, like, touching them if they don't wanna be in touched anything. Not taking their stuff if they don't wanna be taken, if they don't want you to take it. Like asking first, asking permission, something that, anything else that anybody has to share. And then we'll get on to kind of getting back in the group of talking with each other about, um, our break."
342,32,"We didn't have anything do today, did we?"
342,33,Did we have anything to do? Not today. Not today.
342,34,"Okay, good. I was worried. I was worried. I'm sorry."
342,35,"No worry. No problem. Alright,"
342,36,This is boring. So why are we doing this?
342,37,"This is just a reminder to get us back in the group. We're gonna move on to something right now. Yeah, actually. Okay. Um, alright. Okay. So here"
342,38,We go. Okay.
342,39,"Um, to kind of like connect with each other again after a long break. Yeah. We're gonna do, we're each gonna go around and share one thing that we have we saw over break. One thing that we heard over break and one thing Awesome. Did over break. So I'm gonna go first to show you guys how to do, okay. So one thing that I heard over break."
342,40,"Okay. Hey,"
343,0,"Begin simulation. Hi, Eric."
343,1,"Hey, Carlos. How are you?"
343,2,"Good, good. How are you doing?"
343,3,"Good. Um, before we get started, we're just gonna talk about a couple of, um, classroom norms. Do you guys, do you guys know what classroom norms are?"
343,4,"Oh, yeah, definitely. Uhhuh, <affirmative>."
343,5,Can somebody hear me? An example?
343,6,"Um, it's like a rule. Uh, you know, where people should follow. Sit up straight. I am sitting up straight. What are you talking about?"
343,7,"Good. Before we, I just wanna talk about, um, one thing, and it's called respect. Okay. Does anyone know where, what respect is?"
343,8,"Um,"
343,9,Family?
343,10,"Yeah. It's, um, being considerate of people around you."
343,11,"Yeah. Good. Um, yeah, so, oh, no, no, I think you got it right. Sorry. Um,"
343,12,"No, no, no. I'm sorry. My mom is just texting, texting me. That's why I said that. I'm sorry. Um,"
343,13,"No, that's okay. I"
343,14,Took your <laugh>. Sorry.
343,15,"Let's put our phones away for now, and then just talk about Gotcha. Respect for a second. So, mm-hmm. <affirmative>, our biggest, um, I don't wanna call it a rule because it sounds really, it sounds like I'm a dictator or something, but I just wanna talk about how important it is to respect others around you. So, earlier Emily said we should be considerate to each other, but mm-hmm. <affirmative>, we should also respect ourselves. Right? Will, are you okay?"
343,16,"Definitely. Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I, oh, oh, man. I stayed up way too late last night. I was watching videos. I'm sorry. I'm here. I'm awake. I'm awake. I'm here."
343,17,"It's all good, man. So, um, like I said, so let's just be considerate to each other and respect yourselves too. Okay? So later on during the lesson"
343,18,If we ask.
343,19,Okay. All
343,20,"Right. All right. So later on if I ask any questions, um, instead of just, um, saying it without raising our hands, let's, um, raise your hands if you wanna say something. Okay. Okay."
343,21,Okay.
343,22,"Yeah, Jayla."
343,23,"Yeah, I was just thinking of a good, um, classroom norm or like, like a rule, which would be, um, you know, just kind of be ready to work when you get to class. You know, kind of have your homework out or, or, or whatever, you know, we're gonna be discussing and just kind of be ready to get started with the day."
343,24,"Yeah, absolutely. I think it's, I think that's a really good point. Does anyone else wanna add on to Jay's point?"
343,25,"Uh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Um, what's up, Carlos? So we, um, I was just gonna say, I saw the first Ironman movie finally over the weekend, and I just wanted to tell everybody if I haven't seen it. You should. It's pretty good. I, I, I hate superheroes, but I don't anymore. Um, so you can thank Robert Downey Jr. For that. So that's all just"
343,26,Wanted share. Let's talk about that a little bit later.
343,27,Okay? Okay. Gotcha. Gotcha.
343,28,"So, the last thing I wanna talk, what's up, Emily?"
343,29,"Oh, I was just gonna make a suggestion for keep talking. Sorry. Oh, I was gonna say, we should be respectful of other people's like space. So, um, like, you know, running or no, like, you know, pushing people or taking things that aren't yours, baby. I don't know. Just some,"
343,30,"I trust you guys enough to not do that anyway, but I'm glad you point pointed that out. Thank you. Okay. Okay. So one of my biggest, um, the one thing that I think is very, very homework is, let's not put each other down, but try to encourage each other all the time. Okay? Okay. Will do we"
343,31,"Have any homework? Yeah, I'm sorry. I was just asking Mina, do we have any homework? We didn't have anything to do"
343,32,"Today. Did. It's all good, man. I'll, I'll talk about homework and all that stuff later."
343,33,Okay. <laugh>. Alright. All right. Sorry.
343,34,"No, you're good. All right. So what did I say earlier? Let's not put, what did I say? Let's not put it,"
343,35,"This is, yeah, this is boring. Why are we doing this? Forget."
343,36,"Well, I mean, it's important to set rules and norms, like you said earlier, right? Before we get started with the No,"
343,37,You're right. Okay.
343,38,"Yeah. I understand know, it might be a little boring and dry, but this is something that we have. Right, right."
343,39,I got it. Makes sense. Sorry about that.
343,40,"No, you're good, man. All right, so"
343,41,End simulation. All right.
344,0,"Uh, we will begin simulation. Hi there."
344,1,Hi. How are you
344,2,Doing? Good. How was your vacation?
344,3,Good. How was yours?
344,4,"Oh, it was, you know, watched a lot of movies, but Very good. Very good. Thank you."
344,5,"Very good, Carlos. Emily, how was your vacation?"
344,6,"Um, oh, it's fine. It's just, uh, hanging out. That's all."
344,7,"Okay. That sounds nice. Jayla, how's yours?"
344,8,Sit up. Sit up. You sitting up? What are you talking about?
344,9,"Attention, Nina?"
344,10,"Yeah. Hi. Yeah, sorry, just talking to Whale. Just trying to get Will to pay attention over"
344,11,Here. That's okay. Right now is Jayla turn to speak?
344,12,Okay. Sure.
344,13,"If you guys wanna talk's perfectly fine, but you have to talk on our own time, right? Now's Jayla speak, turn to speak. Is that okay?"
344,14,"Yeah. Um, I had a good vacation, you know. Yeah. I volunteered at the Humane Society. It was pretty good. No complains."
344,15,"That sounds great. Will, how was your vacation?"
344,16,"Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My mom is texting. Oh, I forgot something at home. Oh no."
344,17,Is everything.
344,18,"No, it's good. I just at home a lot, so my mom was just reminding me I left my lunch at home, so"
344,19,"<laugh>. Okay. But right now we're talking and we're in class, so if you don't mind putting your phone away, I'd really appreciate it. Yeah,"
344,20,Just did. Okay. I got it.
344,21,Thank you. Did you turn it off as well?
344,22,Yep. Mm-hmm.
344,23,Thank you.
344,24,"Oh, I think I fell asleep. I'm sorry. Ooh, okay. <laugh>. I stayed up way too late last night. Uh, <laugh> watching videos and stuff. I had a good break. Is that what we were talking about? Break?"
344,25,"Yeah, we were talking about break."
344,26,Okay.
344,27,"Nina, did you have a good"
344,28,"Yeah, no complaints. He was all right."
344,29,"Okay. Well that's good. I wanna remind you guys that whenever I'm speaking,"
344,30,Is it three 30
344,31,If you
344,32,Okay.
344,33,"Jayla, Emily? Yeah, I'd like to remind you."
344,34,"Oh yeah, sorry. Okay, sorry."
344,35,I'm speaking. I'd really appreciate if you weren't speaking cause we wanna respect each other and be able to listen to each other.
344,36,"Okay. Thank you. Gotcha. Thank, sorry about that."
344,37,"And if you guys would like to speak further, I'd really appreciate if you'd raise your hand."
344,38,Okay.
344,39,"Yes, Jayla?"
344,40,"Yeah, I was gonna say like, yeah, classroom norm. I would be showing up on time and, uh, being ready to, to work baby. I don't know."
344,41,"Yeah. That's awesome. Does anybody else, is anybody else able to think of other classroom norms that we might have forgotten about over vacation now?"
344,42,"Oh, uh, you know, I finally got to see the first Ironman Carlos. It was pretty,"
344,43,You got to raise your hand if you'd like to speak.
344,44,"Oh, okay, sure. Well, uh, I saw that, um, first Ironman movie over the weekend. It was pretty, it was pretty cool. That's all. I just wanted to share that. I don't know. I'm not really in superhero movies, but this one was, this one was pretty, pretty good."
344,45,So I'm glad you liked it. Does anybody else wanna add anything?
344,46,"Um,"
344,47,"Yes, Emily?"
344,48,"Yeah, I think maybe like a good norm or, or a rule would be if we like respected other people's space and like, didn't, you know, take people's stuff that isn't ours and yeah, just be like, don't get in anyone's personal space and stuff like that."
344,49,So yeah. That's a great role. Does anybody else have any other rules?
344,50,"Was anything due today? No. It's the first day back from vacation. Will Oh, we didn't have anything due. You sure? No. Like a book reporter or anything? Yeah, we didn't have anything due today, did we? I just, I was just thinking, I thought we had something to do. Did we? Yeah."
344,51,"No, we didn't have anything to do. But if you'd like to wonder that next step, appreciate if you just raise your hand and I'd be able to call on you and you're able to ask your"
344,52,"Question. Okay. Yeah. Sorry, I had a little must been that nap I took before. It's"
344,53,Okay. Everybody's so excited from coming back from their break.
344,54,Gotcha.
344,55,Understand.
344,56,"Yeah. This is boring. Uh, why are we doing this?"
344,57,"Because it's good to remind ourselves what's classroom behavior and what's outside classroom behavior. Okay. And we wanna be able to respect each other and what everybody's doing, what everybody has to bring to the conversation. So we wanna make sure we're step each other's toes."
344,58,Makes sense. Okay. Thanks.
344,59,"It's okay to wanna share and it's okay to wanna talk and I know everybody gets really excited, but whenever that happens, we still to remember that other people may be speaking and other people still to say"
344,60,Hello. End simulation. All right.
345,0,For your session to begin. So we will begin simulation. Hi there.
345,1,Hi.
345,2,How was your vacation?
345,3,"Um, it was good. I had a relaxing,"
345,4,"So, yeah, well sit up. Wait, I'm sitting here. What are you talking about? No, you don't look like you're paying attention. You know, she's afraid to say something. Cause"
345,5,"You just, okay. So we're gonna, we're gonna go over, I'm"
345,6,"Comfortable,"
345,7,"We're gonna go over some rules and norms to implement in the classroom this year. So the first one is that we are going to be a community, we're gonna be inclusive of each other, and we should all be working together as a team."
345,8,"Oh, no, I'm sorry. My mom is texting me. I think I, oh no, I think I left my lunch at home. Hold on. I'm sorry. Wait."
345,9,"Let's go over these norms and then let's put away the phone Okay. And then address that later. Sure,"
345,10,"Sure, sure. Okay."
345,11,"Okay. The next one is having respect for one another and for me. So that kind of goes hand in hand with electronics away. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, and it also kind of goes into the next rule, which is, is there a problem? Will"
345,12,"What? Oh, I'm sorry. I Oh, oh geez. Yeah."
345,13,"Let's,"
345,14,"I stayed up. I stayed up Brilliant. Late last night. I'm sorry. I'm, I'm awake now. Sorry about that talk."
345,15,Let's pay attention.
345,16,Yeah. Sorry.
345,17,"The third rule is listening to others and being attentive, whether it's during class discussion. You gonna, to my birthday group work? Lectures"
345,18,Is three 30. Yeah. Three 30. Trampoline park.
345,19,"Okay. So let's not be thinking about when we get out of class, but let's be present in the here and now. The fourth rule is that we're gonna always follow my directions as the teacher. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I wanna help you on your educational journey. And, um, by following my directions, you'll come out, um, by hopefully learning a lot, so mm-hmm. <affirmative> following directions, and again, being respectful. Yes."
345,20,"Yeah. I think a good one would be also like, always being prepared and kind of ready to mm-hmm. <affirmative> work at the beginning of every day, like having your reading done and stuff like that, just so you're, you know, ready to contribute."
345,21,"Absolutely. And that kind of goes along with my last rule. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> is, um, to always try your best and always, I only expect you to get a hundred percent or an A on everything, but I expect, um, a hundred percent effort. And so that goes along with being prepared, doing your readings, whatever. Yeah."
345,22,"I, oh, so I wanted to mention, I finally got to see, uh, the, uh, Leah first Iron Man movie, uh, over the weekend, which was really something. Um, I don't know if anyone else has seen it, but just wanted to put it out there. It is. Excellent. I've been missing out, so."
345,23,"Okay. Yeah. That's not, that's actually kind of breaking one of our class rules, bringing up that right now, not being attention. Okay. Right now to this conversation. That's something great to talk about, maybe at recess, but that's not, that's not in the conversation right now. Yes. Emily?"
345,24,"Um, I think maybe an important norm or rule would be, uh, like respecting personal space. You know, like don't take things from other people, um, without asking, uh, respect, personal space, no. Running, you know, just kinda, um, you know. Yeah."
345,25,"And that goes both ways. Sure. All respect your space and you respect mine. Um, again, we're communities, so I, I now wanna hear about what you guys have to say about what rules and norms that maybe you want in this classroom. Cuz it's yours too."
345,26,"Hmm. Like,"
345,27,"Yes, Carlos."
345,28,"I think a good one is like asking if you need help. Um, you know, uh, if you're having difficulty with something."
345,29,Definitely. Yeah. That's why I'm here. I'm here to help you.
345,30,This is boring. Why are we doing this?
345,31,Because these are the guidelines that are gonna lead our whole rest of our year so we can meet productive in a cohesive classroom. Gotcha. And help this whole year be way more fun and also help guide our learning.
345,32,I got
345,33,You. Let's not use that language.
345,34,"Oh, okay. I understand. Thank you. All right."
346,0,"<affirmative>. Uh, so, uh, we will begin simulation."
346,1,"Hi everyone. My name's Cindy Doe. Um, I hope y'all had a great break. So today, since it's our first day back, we're gonna talk about our expectations. Okay. We're just gonna review them since it's been a while, since everyone's been in the classroom, and I'll wanna make sure everyone remembers them. Okay? So our first one is to stay on task while we're in the classroom. Okay? So this can look like, or let me ask first, does anyone remember what this can look like? Staying on task?"
346,2,"Um, us looking at you. Listen."
346,3,"Yeah, exactly. Eye contact. Ready?"
346,4,I am sitting at Great
346,5,Mina.
346,6,You're not paying attention.
346,7,"I really like the way that you remembered how to stay on task, but one part that you just said was to looking right eye contact with the speaker. So I'd love it if you were able to look at me right, while you were reviewing this, because this is important. Yes. So we wanna stay on task eye contact. Right. We also wanna be, um, sitting at our seats. Right? Should we be running down in the classroom in the hallways when we're on task? No. No. Right? Another part is listening, right?"
346,8,"Yes. Oh, no. Yes. Oh, my mom is that? Oh no, she's texting"
346,9,"And another part Emily. Yeah. Of seeing on. Cause there's one speaker at a time, right? So if I'm speaking, should someone else be talking?"
346,10,"No. No. My mom just texted, so I I I hung"
346,11,"Up the phone. Yeah, no worries. Um, okay, so that's an important part. We wanna stay on task while we're doing our work. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. The second part is we wanna be, our second expectation or norm is being, uh, respectful to others. Right? Will. Yeah. You understand if you're tired, right? We just came a long break, but, oh, no,"
346,12,"We just talked. Sorry about, sorry. I need,"
346,13,And everyone hopefully
346,14,"Listening here, we're"
346,15,Okay. Yep. Our second expectation is being respectful to others. Does anyone have an idea of how we could show that we're respectful to others?
346,16,"Oh. Um, Emily, are you coming to the birthday party? Yeah. [inaudible]"
346,17,"Okay, so can everyone look at me? Where's my eye contact? My"
346,18,Eye contact. I'm sorry.
346,19,"Remember, like I said, our first expectation was, uh, staying on task, which means you are looking at me. You're listening to me because that's what we're doing right now, okay? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, so yeah, we take care of others by keeping our hands to ourselves, right. Listening when others are speaking. So if I want you to speak, right, we want everyone to be looking at you, but since right now I'm the speaker mm-hmm. <affirmative> and there's one speaker at a time, I want you all to be looking at me while I'm speaking,"
346,20,Okay? Mm-hmm.
346,21,"<affirmative>. And yeah. So our third one is to take care of the school. Does anyone have any ideas of how we can take care of our school? Yes. Jayla, thank you so much for raising that."
346,22,"Oh yeah. Oh, sure. Um, I was thinking like, you know, not littering or not a, you know, uh, you know, just being respectful. Like if you make a mess in the, in the cafeteria, you know, clean it up, stuff like that."
346,23,"Yeah, exactly. We want to leave things. Right? We could leave rooms the way they were when we came. Oh, in them, right? Right."
346,24,We don't
346,25,"Want to mess around with the anything that, talking about"
346,26,Hot Rs.
346,27,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. I have saw idea. Carlos.
346,28,"Oh no, I just wanted to say everybody, I, I finally saw the first Iron Man movie and it was so cool and I had been so resistant."
346,29,"Wait, Carlos,"
346,30,"You know, superhero movies, Carlos?"
346,31,"Yeah. Are you staying on task right now by talking about Iron Man while I'm Oh,"
346,32,"Going over. Oh, I was just Sharon. Just Sharon. Yeah,"
346,33,"Sorry about that. Hey, that's all right. I would love to hear more about that if you could tell me more about that during recess or choice time. Okay. So as I was saying, we wanna take care of our school. We want to use materials, how they should be, right? So if I wanna take care of my school, am I gonna bite on all my pencils and kick my tables over and scratch the walls? No. Right? What should I do? Can someone gimme an example of taking care of our school? Another example, Emily, do you have an example of how we could take care of school? Yeah. Yeah,"
346,34,"I do. So like, I dunno, if you get textbooks or like things from school, you should take care of them. Or if you have like, stuff holding your, your papers stuff, you should take care of that."
346,35,"Yeah. Yeah. Or I like that. Thank you Emily. Yeah, we wanna use things how they're supposed to be used, right? We don't want to anything do stand on our textbooks, like the way, um, since that's not the proper way to use it. No. Right? Please count. Oh, so Will, let's, since those are our three expectations that we're gonna go Yeah. Go over. Let's see if you all can remember them. And tell me an example. So Will, can, do you remember what our first expectation was that we went over?"
346,36,"Uh, I think it was, um, keeping our hands toward Zoom? Or was that two?"
346,37,"Um, that's a part of the second one, but that's okay. So how is this? Is,"
346,38,This is boring. Why are we doing
346,39,"This? So we're doing this because it's important, right? Because we want to be in a safe classroom and we wanna take care of ourselves. We wanna take care of each other, and we wanna take care of our schools. And since it's been a long break, we want to review them so that we can be in the best zone to learn. Great."
346,40,<laugh>. Hey. Okay.
347,0,"Hello, begin simulation."
347,1,"Hi everyone. How is everyone today? Hey,"
347,2,"Nick. Good, how are you?"
347,3,"I'm so good. I missed you guys so much when we were on vacation, but I'm so glad that you're back in the classroom now, and I know we've been gone for a while, so I think that it would benefit everyone, myself included, if we go over our classroom rules. So remember we have four of them, so I'll just go ahead and list them for you guys first. Okay. So the first one was to listen to others when they speak with our eyes and our bodies. So who could"
347,4,"Tell me, sit, listen,"
347,5,"Mina, this is a great example. So could you tell me a great way to show others that you're listening?"
347,6,"Oh, um, just like face friend and pay attention. That's what I was telling."
347,7,"Yeah. Yeah, to pay attention. So we can do that with our eyes and our bodies. So with our eyes we can make eye contact. That's one way to show attention and another is to have your body facing forward. Great. So let's look at our second one. Our second one was to raise your hand if you have a question. Oh, dear. Or you're answering a question. So, Emily, if you have a question, what should you do if you have a question that you want to ask the teacher?"
347,8,"Oh, I'm sorry, mom just started texting me, so I'm just telling her to, because you say left something at home."
347,9,"Yeah. Well, we're all getting back used to being at school, so let's remember not to use our phones right now. Okay."
347,10,Okay. Her up.
347,11,"You can wait until the end of the day. She'll understand, I promise. Okay."
347,12,So
347,13,"We can raise our hand if we have a question or we want to answer. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> question. So should we shout out if we have a question that counts, right?"
347,14,"Um, definitely, definitely not,"
347,15,"Definitely not. That's not the same time thing as raising our hands for a question. So let's go back to our first one. Remember, we want to make sure that we're maintaining eye contact and having our bodies sitting up so others are paying attention, right? Will."
347,16,"Yeah. Oh yeah. I I, I I was really tired. I'm sorry I fell asleep, but I'm awake now."
347,17,"I'm awake. I know we're all getting used to being back in school, but let's try to do our best with these rules now that we're back. All right. All right. Now let's talk about our third one. So if you have something off topic to say, so it's not something we're talking about in school, maybe it's something about your vacation, we can save that for after school or for recess. Cool. Okay, because I have stuff I'd love to tell you about my vacation too, but I'll wait till recess. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> and we can all talk about it today, right? Yeah. Jayla."
347,18,"Yeah, I was just thinking like another good one would be like, you know, just showing up on time and like, I was being like, ready to work on whatever you're working on."
347,19,"Yeah. Jayla, I think that's an awesome example. Thank you for sharing that. That's a great rule."
347,20,No
347,21,"Problem. It's especially good to remember now that we're back from vacation because showing up on time can be hard. Like Will was saying he was sleepy, so we might wanna sleep in, but showing up on time, why, why is it important to show up on time? Emily, do you have any thoughts? Oh,"
347,22,"Oh, you know, I was gonna say everybody, I finally got to see the first Ironman movie. Carlos,"
347,23,"If you have a thought, could you either raise your hand if it has to with the discussion or save it for recess?"
347,24,"Okay, I'll save it. I'll save it. No problem. Thank you."
347,25,"No problem. Great. So back to where, what I was saying. So Emily, why do you think it's important to, um, show up on time to school?"
347,26,"Oh, because, and like, you know, everyone will be on like the same page. Yeah. And, you know, we'll be able to have like discussions and stuff like that, you know? I agree. All kinda, yeah. Know we want, we want working together. Yeah. Yeah. I was gonna also say, um, while I'm talking, uh, another good one would be being like, uh, respectful of people's space and not like, you know, phone or you're getting, you know, getting in people's space."
347,27,"So, yeah. Yeah, I agree. Emily. So, Mina, do you have an example? What might Emily mean? Why? What's an example of not staying in our own space?"
347,28,"Oh, Mina. Did, did we have a anything due today in work? No."
347,29,"Well, if you have a question, remember you can raise your hand, but if it doesn't have to do with class Okay, then let's save it for later."
347,30,"Okay. Well, I thought we added homework, but I guess we don't. We"
347,31,"Probably don't. All right. We can save that for later. Okay. Right now we'll just go over <inaudible> rules. So Mina, do you have any thoughts on that?"
347,32,This is boring. Why? Why are we doing the cn?
347,33,"I don't. Why, why do you think we are doing this? Jayla? Does anyone have any ideas? Why should we look over our classroom rules? We already made them, so why would we do that? Um, yeah, Mina."
347,34,"Yeah. So like we can, um, you know, all have kinda a set of, uh, standards that we would all, we all know we have to kind of meet, like pay attention and show up."
347,35,Yeah. So we can all have the same set of standards.
347,36,"Hey,"
348,0,"For your session to start. Uh, so begin simulation. Hello."
348,1,I need to talk right <laugh>.
348,2,Okay. Hi there. Hi. Hey there. How are you?
348,3,I'm well. How are you all
348,4,Doing All right. How was your break?
348,5,It was great. How was you guys' day when I wasn't here?
348,6,"It was okay. We had a good time. I watched a lot of movies, that's for sure."
348,7,Nice. What did you watch?
348,8,"Um, oh wow. I should get a list."
348,9,<laugh>.
348,10,"Oh, well I'm sitting here. What are you talking about? You should sit up Peter. Paying attention. I, I'm, what do you mean? Wait."
348,11,"So we're going to review the expectations of the classroom, especially during transitions. So who, who can tell me what we do in the classroom? Who can tell me one expectation?"
348,12,"Um, let, oh, sorry. I'm getting a text from my mom. Oh, no. If again, that's something at home. Oh, no. Oh, no. Um, you know, we should, if we're transitioning, I think, uh, you know, uh, taking, um, being quiet and being respectful with each other, does that happens is a good idea."
348,13,What would respect for being quiet? What would that look like and sound like?
348,14,"Um, I guess like not having straight conversations and stuff and just sort of getting from one place to the other without too much of a, a fuss."
348,15,Okay. Yeah.
348,16,Hmm.
348,17,"Um, will, what do you think another expectation is?"
348,18,"Oh, oh, dear. I, you know what? I, I stayed up with you late last night. I'm sorry, I'm awake now. Um, what was the question?"
348,19,What do you think another expectation is? Jayla told us one. What do you think?
348,20,"Are you gonna come today? Birthday party lady? The end trampoline. Oh, oh, jump. Oh, cool."
348,21,Let's give our friend will a turn.
348,22,"Yeah. Um, so well talk. Oh, um, okay. Uh, yeah, I think, I think, uh, being like respectful means like paying attention and like, uh, maybe keeping your hands to yourself and like doing your work when you're supposed to. Yeah."
348,23,Yeah. That's awesome. Thanks for sharing.
348,24,"Sure, sure."
348,25,Does anyone have anything else?
348,26,"Yeah, I think I've another one."
348,27,"Oh, thanks for raising your hand, Jayla."
348,28,"Sure. Um, so I was thinking like, you know, it's always good to show up on time and, uh, you know, always be ready to work, you know, on, on whatever we are supposed to be talking about or, or do our reading or, or discussion or whatever. So we should just be like, kind of ready to go,"
348,29,"Right? Yeah, very true."
348,30,"Oh, oh, you know what I was just gonna say about movies, I, you know, I finally saw the first Ironman and let me tell you what, a movie, uh, that Robert Downey Jr. Is, uh, is a talent, that's for sure. So, I dunno if you've seen it. I'm not a big fan of superheroes myself, but, wow. Good stuff, stuff."
348,31,"And Nina, do you have another expectation that we should follow?"
348,32,"Um, maybe like, uh, you know, um, not eating in class maybe."
348,33,Yeah.
348,34,I
348,35,"Have fun. Oh, Emily. Yeah."
348,36,"Yeah. So I think to maybe be respectful of other people's space and not to like, pick things that aren't yours and things like that."
348,37,Yeah. Something
348,38,"Like an assignment today or anything. We didn't have like a, like any homework did we?"
348,39,"No. Have any homework? No, I don't think we had any homework."
348,40,"I didn't think so. I I just, that nap kind of threw me off. I'm sorry. Um, yeah. Okay. Cool, cool, cool. I'm sorry."
348,41,"So what are you, what are we doing today?"
348,42,"Oh, I don't know. I'd love to talk about Ironman, that's for sure. This is kind of boring. Why are we doing this? What are we doing?"
348,43,"Well, we had to review the expectations because I was on vacation and I didn't want you guys to forget."
348,44,"Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, makes sense."
348,45,An awesome job with remembering.
348,46,"Okay. Right now I already thought of like two norms, so pick up some Slack guys. Come, geez. All right. And."
349,0,"Your session to begin. Okay. Uh, so we will begin simulation."
349,1,All right. Good morning class. It's been a while. Hi. Saw you all. How is everyone?
349,2,It was good. How we yours?
349,3,"It was great. Yeah. I did some traveling, but I'm really happy to be back cuz we have Nice, a lot of very interesting things to learn. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, before we start, let's review our class expectations. Let's start with our class routine. So remember beginning of the school year, he all became very familiar with our class routine In the morning, well"
349,4,Sit up
349,5,Nina.
349,6,Sorry.
349,7,"It's okay. Our class routine involves coming into the class quietly. You can talk with your friends, but don't yell. We're at a voice level of one. Maybe a whisper or, or soft talking tone. And you unpack your things and look at the morning message. Another thing that I, I think we should review is we raise our hands when we wanna say something. I know sometimes it's really hard to to to wait your turn if you have something to say. But just remember to raise your hand and I'll, I'll definitely call on you."
349,8,"Oh no, I'm getting a text. Oh no, that's something at home,"
349,9,"Emily. Yes. Emily, do you remember our expectation having to do with technology?"
349,10,"Um, no. Well, sort of, my mom texted and said I left my, my lunch at home, but I put the phone away,"
349,11,"So. Okay. That's right. You put the phone away. Unless it's an emergency, then you, it needs to be put away. And even if there is an emergency, you would the, your parent would contact me and I would contact you. Hey Will,"
349,12,"Yeah. Will I off? Oh dear. I'm sorry. You know what? I stayed up too late last night and I, I'm sorry, I'm awake now."
349,13,"That's okay. That's understandable. If you ever feel really sleepy or you need a, a little wiggle break, just raise your hand and we're going quiet corner and get some water and sit down, wake up a little bit."
349,14,"Are you gonna go to the birthday party? Um, yeah. Is it at"
349,15,"The, do you remember Yeah. The difference between our learning time and our social time?"
349,16,"Oh yeah. I was just checking in with, um, Emily about, uh, a birthday party later."
349,17,"So Yeah, I could do that"
349,18,"Later. No, babe."
349,19,"Exactly. You could do that during recess or lunch, but not right now. Okay,"
349,20,Sure.
349,21,"Great. And remember when we are in the classroom and wherever we go, we use respectful words to each other. So please be kind to your friends cuz we want this to be kind and fun learning environment. Jayla, thanks for raising your hand. What do you have to share?"
349,22,"Sure. Oh, I was thinking, um, maybe a good, a good rule would also be, you know, showing up on time and just always being ready, you know, to work, um, on whatever we're doing at the beginning of class."
349,23,"Yeah, I totally agree. I think that's a great idea. Show up on time. Ready to work with all your supplies."
349,24,"Oh, oh, you know what I wanted to mention, um, everybody, I finally got to see the first Ironman movie. I'm not a big superhero"
349,25,Fan. Carlos.
349,26,"It's so great, Carlos."
349,27,"We'll have a time later to share what we did over break, but right now we're viewing our experts."
349,28,"Okay, I gotcha. Okay. Sorry about"
349,29,"That. Uh, I'd love to hear about that later."
349,30,"Okay. Okay,"
349,31,"<laugh>, so we use respectful words no interrupting. And make sure you have all your material materials ready. And if you forgot some something, just let me know and we'll figure it out. Emily, do you have something to share?"
349,32,"Yeah. Um, I was thinking maybe one would be a good one would be like, um, respecting people's space and not, you know, touching things that aren't yours and, you know, uh, running or doing anything. Right. Crazy."
349,33,"Use calm body when we're in the classroom. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So running, no. Touching other things without"
349,34,Permission. Do any homework. Do we have to do
349,35,"Hey, will, do you have a question?"
349,36,"Yeah. Oh yeah. I, we don't have like any homework today, do we? I didn't know. No,"
349,37,I didn't assign homework over our
349,38,"Break. Okay. That nap threw me off. I'm sorry. <laugh>. It's okay. Okay, got it."
349,39,"Yeah, as I was saying, music, calm body when we're in the classroom, so make sure you save your running and all your, um, big activities and playing out for recess when we go outside,"
349,40,This is boring. Why are we doing this?
349,41,We're doing this because sometimes it takes a few days for us to get back into the routine. Mm-hmm.
349,42,But once
349,43,"We're routine and we won't, all these things will come as so naturally we won't really have to remind you. Gotcha. Else."
349,44,"That's why. Okay, I gotcha."
349,45,Are there any other class expectations that you remember us using from the beginning of the year?
349,46,"Hmm, maybe. Uh, alright."
350,0,"Uh, so we will begin simulation."
350,1,Hi class.
350,2,Hi there.
350,3,I hope you all have a good summer vacation.
350,4,"Oh yeah, we did."
350,5,"Okay. So to start off the school year, we're gonna go over some class norms. Do you guys know what class norms are? Go ahead and raise your hand if you do, if you can raise your hand. Oh"
350,6,"Yeah, they're like rules or, um, you know, things to follow for us. Kinda good class."
350,7,"Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. There are rules, there are things we wanna follow to keep everyone"
350,8,Safe up.
350,9,"Let's, we're paying attention. Okay. Nina?"
350,10,Okay. Sure.
350,11,"Okay. So where I want us to all be involved in making up our class rules, right. Since we all are in this class. So I'm gonna go ahead and say, uh, a rule I think that we should all have, I think we should all raise our hand before we speak. Okay. Just to make sure that everyone gets a chance and so we're not talking over each other. Okay. So that's gonna be our first classroom rule. Raise your hand if you have something to say. Okay. Especially during instruction."
350,12,"Oh dear. I just gonna, you"
350,13,Ok?
350,14,"Yeah. Yeah. Um, I just gotta text from my mom. I guess. I left my lunch at home. Oh dear. Sorry,"
350,15,"Emily. Let's try not to, let's try not to use our phones. That could be another good one, right? I think."
350,16,"Oh yeah, I think so."
350,17,"Yeah. I think your mom could always get in touch with us if she really needed to. Okay. So how about Mina? Would you like to, uh, Carlos, we'll start out with Carlos. What's, uh, classroom norm you think we should have? What rules"
350,18,"Should? Um, I think, you know, showing up on time and kind of always being ready to work, uh, and participate. I think that's a pretty good, uh, that's a good start, I think."
350,19,"Yeah, Carlos, those are both great rules to follow. We definitely will add them to our classroom rules. We just wanna make sure we try to show up in time if, if we can. And, um, yeah. Emily, what about you?"
350,20,"Oh dear. Um, oh, I'm sorry I fell asleep. Um, ok. Well, oh, Jay, are you gonna bed? Birthday party? Yeah."
350,21,"Emily, do you a norm you'd wanna share? We have birthday party. Sorry. Let's talk about that."
350,22,"Sorry, I got distracted. Um, I think that, uh hmm. No eating in class is good. I think that'd be distracting."
350,23,"Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. No eating in class unless we're really hungry. Or it's the morning when we have breakfast sometimes and some students may eat breakfast in class. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, let's try to keep it to our snack time and our lunchtime. Go ahead. Dayla, what do you think?"
350,24,"Yeah, I just had another, um, norm suggestion. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, uh, maybe, uh, you know, if you're having a tough time like, you know, with work or, or with something, with an assignment, um, to ask for help."
350,25,Exactly. Ask
350,26,"For help, you know, just kinda, yes. You know,"
350,27,"Ask for help, let me know. Uh, you can always take a break and chill out and calm down the corner over here. Okay."
350,28,"Oh, you know, I wanted to mention everybody. I finally got to see that first, um, iron Man movie and"
350,29,"It was Oh, Carlos. Wow. It's really cool. But can we talk about that during recess?"
350,30,"Oh, okay. Mm-hmm. Sorry. Yep."
350,31,"Yep. Will No problem. Will, do you have a classroom norm that you'd like to share?"
350,32,"Um hmm. Well I think I did it before, but maybe like youre sleeping in class. Uh, cause that could be I dozed off before and that's not good, so."
350,33,"Yeah. Yeah. We'll try not to sleep in class. Sometimes we're really tired, but we, we, we wanna stay awake so we learn. Right. Go ahead Emily."
350,34,I be respectful. Running or like kicking things that aren't yours. Things like that.
350,35,"Yeah, exactly. Be respectful of people's space and their feelings too. Right. We don't wanna say mean words that can hurt people. No."
350,36,"Nina, did we have homework? We didn't Homework."
350,37,"Well, well let's make sure we're paying attention, okay. Because Nina hasn't Oh"
350,38,"Mom yet. I was just asking, I was asking Mina if we had any homework and stuff. I, I just, you I fell asleep."
350,39,That's ok. My brain Thursday. You're ok.
350,40,Okay. That's cool Nina.
350,41,Awesome. Do you have a classroom?
350,42,"Um, sure. Uh, I think you best. Yeah. Hard card handing your things in on time. I think it's good handing working in on time. It's"
350,43,"Good. That's a great norm to have. And it's kinda like Jayla at two, right? Yeah. Always try to keep um, if we're frustrated, if we are, if we're having a hard time mm-hmm. Come after happy."
350,44,This is boring. Why are we doing this again?
350,45,"We're doing this so that we can set up some rules right? Uhhuh. So that we can follow the rest of the year. Right. I know it's not always the most fun thing, but we have to do it."
350,46,And simulation. Alright.
351,0,"For your session to begin, is the audio still good? Yeah, just making sure. Okay. All right. Uh, here we go. So, begin simulation."
351,1,Hi there.
351,2,Hi.
351,3,Hello.
351,4,"Welcome back from break. I'm glad to see you all back here. Um, today, I, before we start learning, I just wanna go over our classroom norms that we agreed upon at the very beginning of the school year, if you remember those. So, first and most important one is that we need to be actively listening to each other. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So when I'm talking, I need you guys all to be sit, focus, focused. Eyes on me up here. That is what active listening looks like. I need you guys looking at me, and also I need your voices turned off. I love how Jayla is sitting there, actively listening. She's quiet with her eyes focused on me, and she is not talking. That is a perfect example of what active listening looks like. We're gonna make sure to practice that throughout the classroom for the rest of the year. Both when you guys, when I'm speaking and when you're speaking to each other. Okay. <laugh>. So when you're talking to each other, I also to this be making sure you're paying attention, listening with your whole entire body. So getting"
351,5,"A text. Oh, no."
351,6,Okay. And then the next classroom go over is respectful communication.
351,7,Okay.
351,8,"So I need us to all be respectful when other people are speaking and I need us be looking at the speaker. I need to just be using kind words, kind body language. Does anyone have any questions about those norms that we discussed? Will, did you have a question?"
351,9,"Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I, I stayed up way too late last night. I, I, I was napping. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm here. I'm awake. I'm awake now."
351,10,"Thank you for communicating that with me. I really appreciate that. Sure, sure. Make sure we're listening for the rest of class and being respectful to the birthday party. Any problems?"
351,11,"Ok, I'm gonna, I think I'm gonna go to the trampoline park. Yeah, it's gonna be at three 30. Oh, should be fun. I'm"
351,12,Boys and girls. I have a question. Does actively listening mean having conversations with your other classmates while the teacher's talking?
351,13,"Uh, definitely not. Definitely not. I think that kind of flies in the face of it for sure."
351,14,"You're right, Carlos. So I want to make sure that when the teacher is talking, that everyone else is listening and not having their own separate conversations, because I could be saying something very important, like I just was."
351,15,Okay.
351,16,"Thank you, Carlos. All right. Are we ready to get Yes, Jayla?"
351,17,"Yeah, I was thinking, um, maybe one of the norms that would work would be, um, showing up on time and just being ready to work, like when school starts, you know, with our, uh, readings or homework or whatever we're working on."
351,18,Perfect. I love what you just said. We can add that to our classroom norms moving forward. So what Jayla just said is
351,19,"That, oh, I wanted to say, I, I know what I, I did get to see the first Ironman movie, uh, over vacation. It was fantastic."
351,20,"Carlos, can we raise our hands if we have something to say and we have to make sure it's relevant to our conversation. So do you have something to add to Jay's norm of being prepared and ready for class?"
351,21,"Uh, uh, I think it was more Ironman focused, so I'll, I'll just say this one out. No problem."
351,22,"Okay, perfect. Let's save that conversation for later. Alright. What Jayla said, I just wanna make sure everyone heard it. We're gonna be making sure to come to class prepared and with all of our materials and being ready to learn. Emily, did you have a question?"
351,23,"Yeah, I was gonna say, you know, I think it's important to be, you know, respectful of, you know, uh, peoples space, so, you know, or things, so don't, you know, take things that aren't yours or run in class or push anyone or just Yeah. Physically respectful."
351,24,"So, perfect. I love you said a whole bunch of things."
351,25,Have homework to be at homework.
351,26,"Hey, will, let's make sure Yeah. Emily, in our conversation, please."
351,27,"Oh, I am, I was just worried we had homework. I'm sorry. I'm"
351,28,"Sorry. Emily just said that we need to be respectful of each other's materials. That means keeping your hands to yourself and not touching anyone, other, anyone else's materials. And then she also, mm-hmm. <affirmative> wanted to make sure that everyone's being respectful with their bodies and not pushing or running. So we're gonna walk in our classroom and we are gonna keep our hands to ourselves. I'm gonna go ahead and add those two to our classroom norms. Keep your hands to yourselves and use walking feet in our classroom. Ok. Everyone is"
351,29,"Safe. Yeah, this is boring. Why are we doing this?"
351,30,"It is very important to talk about classroom norms because we wanna have a classroom community where everyone is safe and can be listened to. Does that make sense,"
351,31,"Jayla? Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Just checking. Thank you."
351,32,"Does anyone else have any more norms to add? We have respectful communication, active listening, coming to class"
351,33,"In simulation. All right. Well, thank you so much for completing that simulation."
352,0,"Uh, it is time for your session to begin. So we will begin simulation."
352,1,Hi. Good morning everybody.
352,2,Hey there.
352,3,"Um, I heard you guys have been on a break recently."
352,4,Oh yeah. How was your break?
352,5,"Um, it was very nice. I got to be, have a restful break. How was everyone elses?"
352,6,"Sweet. Oh, had a great time. It was good. Great."
352,7,"All right. So I know that after we've had a break, it's sometimes hard to remember all the things that we've put in place. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, um, when we were back in school, it's almost been, well"
352,8,Sit up.
352,9,"Alright. So tell me, well, Nina, can, can either of you tell me one of our classroom rules that we had before break?"
352,10,"Um, I think one would be, uh, no cell phones in class."
352,11,"Definitely. And do you have mm-hmm. <affirmative>, do we, do we ever talk about a reason why we really don't wanna be having our cell phones out during class?"
352,12,"Uh, it's disruptive, I think."
352,13,"Definitely. And it doesn't allow us to listen to our other friends and,"
352,14,"Oh, no,"
352,15,"You're what they're saying. Um, Emily, do you have anything you remember?"
352,16,"Sorry, my mom is texting me. I'm just trying. Oh,"
352,17,"Emily, so what did, what did we just go over? Yeah,"
352,18,"We just said that. No phones. I was just get rid of her. So,"
352,19,"Um, if it's important, um, you can just raise your hand and ask me and, um, and deal with it, um, together later. Does anyone else have a classroom norm that they wanna go over that they remember we were using?"
352,20,"Um hmm. Oh,"
352,21,"I remember one. Um, I remember that We, when we want something. Okay. We're gonna raise our hand for attention."
352,22,Mm-hmm.
352,23,"<affirmative>. Well, are you tired from your break?"
352,24,"Whoa, <laugh>. Oh no. Oh, sorry. I was just, I just went off into Dreamland for a second. Yeah, I, I stayed up too late last night, but I'm, yeah, I'm here now. Sorry about that."
352,25,"It's okay. Um, we're all trying to get back on track after break. So what I was saying"
352,26,"Is birthday party,"
352,27,"Um,"
352,28,"Should be fun, please. Yeah."
352,29,"So a good example would be to make sure that when someone else is talking, Emily, when someone else is talking, um, we wanna give them our full attention. That would be one of our classroom norms so we can all hear each other, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, and I remember that we had one to raise our hands and we have something to say. So if you'd like to share something with the art group, you're more than welcome to raise your hand and share. Yeah. Jayla."
352,30,"Yeah, I was thinking maybe, um, a good norm would be just, you know, showing up on time and, and like, being ready to, to work or, or, or do whatever, like homework we have to do or whatever assignment for the day and just gotta be ready to participate."
352,31,"So I love that. Just show up ready to, um mm-hmm. <affirmative> participate. Yeah. And on time is really important. It's a good skill."
352,32,Okay. I think. Yeah.
352,33,"Yeah. Thank you so much. Um,"
352,34,"Oh, um, I just wanted everyone to know,"
352,35,To give us an idea.
352,36,"Oh, sure, sure. I just wanted everyone to know that I, that I did get to see the, the first Ironman movie after all, and I thought it was fantastic and I just wanted to put that out there. Um, if anyone's, I"
352,37,"Love that you're sharing, hopefully you guys can share more of your stories during recess or some free time. Okay. Um, do we have any other classroom norms that we wanna go over? Um, raise your hand if you have a thought. Yeah, yeah, Emily."
352,38,"So, uh, I think like, um, maybe like being respectful of people's space and like, internet, like touching someone's things who aren't, that aren't yours or, or like running or, you know, pushing people, you know, just being respectful with your body."
352,39,So being respectful with your body to keep us safe as well as to just make sure that we're being respectful of other people's things. I love that. That was one of the classroom ones that I had on my list as well.
352,40,"<laugh>. Oh, did we have any homework? Mina, did"
352,41,"We have, well, if you have something you wanna share, you can definitely raise your hand and share with us."
352,42,"Oh. Oh, you know, I was just, I was asking Nina, um, what, what if we had like any homework or a book report,"
352,43,"Anybody? Oh, well that's definitely something you could have raised your hand and we can cover that later. But Emily was talking about being safe with our bodies. Can you think of a time where it would be important to, um, keep our hands to itself?"
352,44,"Yeah. Like when we're maybe transitioning from, you know, class to class or going to the lunchroom and stuff. Like, just to be"
352,45,"Definitely, that's a great example."
352,46,"This is,"
352,47,Or on the playground.
352,48,"This is flooring. Why are, why are we doing this"
352,49,"Again? Um, does anyone know why we would go over our classroom norms after the break?"
352,50,"Oh, just a, like a refresher, you know? Yeah,"
352,51,"Definitely. Yeah. A refresher because all these keep us from Oh, staying safe, having a, um, learning environment where everybody can learn, right. Can have a great rest of our school year."
352,52,"I hear that. That makes sense. Yeah,"
352,53,That's a good question cuz it is important.
352,54,Alright. End.
353,0,"Okay, so we will begin simulation."
353,1,Hi everybody. How are you doing today?
353,2,Doing good. How are you?
353,3,I'm good. Welcome back. I'm glad to see you all back here. Did everyone have a nice vacation?
353,4,"Oh yeah, definitely."
353,5,"All right. I'm glad we had some time off to rest and relax, but let's talk about getting back into our school routine. Can somebody remind me of some of the norms we talked about at the beginning of the school year?"
353,6,"Um,"
353,7,"How do we treat our other, our fellow students in class?"
353,8,Well sit up. Okay.
353,9,"Nina Mina, do you have any ideas?"
353,10,"Oh, um, I think it's good to show up on time and"
353,11,"Show up on time. That's a good one. Yeah, we work hard. Okay. So since it might be different in some of our families, um, how do we treat our fellow students in class? Do we talk to them while the teachers talking? Do we use nice voices?"
353,12,"Um,"
353,13,Emily.
353,14,"Nice. I think we would Oh. Oh no, I'm giving a text. Oh, no. Oh,"
353,15,"No. Oh. Emily, if you could please put your phone away."
353,16,Okay. I got it. Got it. Put it away. Sorry about that. Hi.
353,17,"All right. Emily, did you have anything you wanted to share? How did we treat other students in class? Can you remind us? I"
353,18,Think respect.
353,19,"With respect. Very good, Emily. Sure. Okay. And when it's time to work, what does our voice look like? Do we have a loud voice? Will, or do we have a quiet voice? And a calm voice?"
353,20,"Oh, um, I'm sorry. Ooh, just stop there. Oh, no, dear. I stayed up way too late last night. I'm sorry. Um,"
353,21,"That's okay. Well, quiet,"
353,22,Quiet voices.
353,23,Quiet
353,24,Voice or a good idea. Yeah. Thank
353,25,"You. Well, sure, sure. Okay. And when it's time for writing or it's time for reading, what do we do? Do"
353,26,To
353,27,"Stay focused and work hard? Or are we busy playing? Emily, do you wanna share?"
353,28,"Oh, um, oh, we would probably wanna focus. Yeah."
353,29,Yeah. Thank you. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. Does anybody wanna add anything? Did we miss any? What's a reminder of something we should be focused on now that we're back from vacation and we're back in school?
353,30,Yeah.
353,31,Anyone have any ideas they wanna add? Jayla?
353,32,"Yeah. I mean, this is a small one, but maybe like, no eating in class."
353,33,"Yeah, that's a great one. Or maybe ask if you need, if you're super hungry and need to eat in and ask. Of course."
353,34,Thank
353,35,You. Jayla. I love that Jayla came up with her own norm. Does anybody else have anything they wanna raise their hand and share?
353,36,"Hmm, hmm,"
353,37,Hmm. Let's think
353,38,"What's,"
353,39,What's one way you'd like to be treated by your fellow students? Will did you wanna add?
353,40,"Yeah, I think, uh, I think it's good to, um, yeah, always try to do your best, maybe. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Oh. Oh. Um, I just wanted to mention, you know, I saw the first Ironman movie over, over the vacation and, and it was something, I mean, I'm not into superheroes"
353,41,"Usually. Oh, Carlos, thank you for sharing. Carlos. Right now we're like, we just talked about, we're staying focused on the task at hand, so don't least have to share about vacation late or maybe in writing. Okay. But right now we're talking about our classroom norms, getting back into our routine. Carlos, did you wanna add about any norms you wanted to share?"
353,42,Come up with I've got one.
353,43,"Oh, Emily's got one. Emily, what do you think? Yeah,"
353,44,"So I think to be like, respectful, it's mm-hmm. <affirmative> like body, um, okay. Of other people's space. So like, take, like, I wouldn't wanna take Carlos' tablet or something that's not mine. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, maybe No running or, or stuff like that. Like, just be safe, safe bodies."
353,45,"Having safe bodies. Emily, I love that one. That's a great one. Thank you for sharing. Emily. Oh, Mina heard a lot about being respectful. Can somebody tell me what respect means? What does that look like? Will and Mina, do you guys have anything you wanted to share?"
353,46,"Yeah, I was asking Mina if we had like, anything due today. I just didn't, I didn't, uh, I didn't wanna miss anything, but, but I,"
353,47,"I know you didn't wanna miss anything. I don't think now's a good time. Will, I think Mina's trying to stay focused on our discussion. Okay."
353,48,Okay.
353,49,Thank you though.
353,50,Yeah.
353,51,"Did any, so we've talked a lot about respect. Does anybody wanna share what they think respect means to them?"
353,52,"Uh, this is boring. We're all on the same. Why are we doing this?"
353,53,Jayla it's important to be all on the same page as we get back from vacation.
353,54,Right. Okay. That makes sense. I understand.
353,55,Okay. Yeah. So does anybody else have anything to add?
353,56,"Oh, um, end."
354,0,"So, uh, we'll begin simulation. Hi Eric."
354,1,"Hello, friends. So today we're gonna go over some norms, um, our, in our classroom. Just a reminder of what it's like to be in the classroom. Hmm. So, Nina, can you tell me, um, what it means to be kind and courteous?"
354,2,"Oh. Um, I think they treat people the way they wanna be treated, you know?"
354,3,Very true.
354,4,Sit up. What
354,5,Somina do you think that we could have been a little bit kinder to Will?
354,6,"Oh, I'm sorry. I just wanna make sure he was paying attention. Oh yeah,"
354,7,"That is totally okay. Just remember there's a way to be respectful when we're asking someone to do something, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, that's where our kind and courteous skills come"
354,8,In. That's right.
354,9,"Now can anybody tell me what, um, listening skills we can use in our class today?"
354,10,"Um, oh no. Oh dear. I'm sorry. My mom is texting. Oh. Oh dear. She said I forgot something at home. Oh, no,"
354,11,"That's okay. Emily, do you just wanna take a moment? Yeah, yeah."
354,12,Jayla [inaudible] call me back.
354,13,"Yeah. Alright. Probably put the phone away, right?"
354,14,"Okay. Yeah, I think she did that."
354,15,"All right. Jayla, can you tell me what listening skills are that we can use in the classroom?"
354,16,"Oh, sure. I think, you know, speaking, um, yeah, after you raise your hand, um, you know, stuff like that,"
354,17,"I think. Exactly. Will, or Carlos, do you have anything to add?"
354,18,"Uh hmm. I think, uh, maybe we already said no cell phones. I think showing up on time is important, you know, and being ready to work. Hmm."
354,19,"So, will, do you think that you're using your active listening skills right now?"
354,20,"Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I stayed up so late last night. I apologize. I'm, I'm here, I'm awake. It"
354,21,"It's okay. It's the day after break friends, so sometimes we're gonna be a little bit tired and not be able to That's right. Right. Are you gonna hear, all right. So can anybody tell me what being respectful means? Do you think that goes along with being kind and courteous and actively"
354,22,"Listening? Um, I think I can go, yeah."
354,23,And feel free to raise your hand to answer so that way we're not all talking at once.
354,24,"Oh. Oh, okay. Sorry about that. Um, oh, I guess I'll"
354,25,Jayla go ahead. What is chime
354,26,"In with one? Um, yeah, so I was thinking, uh, you know, maybe to sort of bounce on, I think what Carlos said, I think, you know, have one person talking to the Italian and uh, I think we talked about respectful language, so maybe, uh, yeah. How about something simple like no eating in class, that can be really distracting, I think. Mm-hmm."
354,27,<affirmative>. Exactly. I agree. Does anybody else have anything they wanna add?
354,28,"Uh oh. Um, I finally saw the first Ironman movie. Everybody, I, I, I just had resisted for so long and I just wanted to say it was awesome. So that's"
354,29,Alright. Well thank you Carlos. I'm glad to hear that. Sure. Probably not the conversation for this time. Right.
354,30,"Oh, okay."
354,31,That's ok. Sometimes
354,32,Talk about that.
354,33,It's ok. Gotcha. Just need reminders. Can you tell me what being respectful is in the classroom?
354,34,"Um, I think it's listening, you know, to people when they're talking and participating and, you know, kinda working together as a team. Mm-hmm."
354,35,"<affirmative>. All right. Oh, does anybody else have any questions or comments on our different classroom norms? Yes, Emily?"
354,36,"Yeah. Uh, I think, you know, um, being respectful of other people's like bodies and space. Uh, so, so like, don't take things that aren't yours or, you know, like run around or push someone, you know, just kinda safe bodies I guess would be the be"
354,37,"The Right. Exactly. Safe bodies is another thing that we use in the classroom, not homework interrupting. Do you have something you wanted to, to, um, talk to us about Will?"
354,38,"Oh no, I was just asking, I was asking Mina, who's not answering me, um, about if we had anything due today, but I guess we don't if it was vacations, so. Alright, well"
354,39,"Sorry, this is probably not the time to ask Mina about any homework assignments. Right. Okay. I think that I could wait a few minutes."
354,40,I can wait. Sure.
354,41,"All, and we'll go over that later. So don't worry."
354,42,"This is, um, boring. Why are we doing,"
354,43,"Um, well, Jayla, sometimes we just need reminders of things that we need to do in the classroom and you guys have been on break, so we just wanna go over the classroom norms and make sure everybody still understands and remembers what to do. So that's why we go over them."
354,44,"I gotcha. That makes sense. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, sorry. Cool."
354,45,"No, thank you for asking. Jayla. Is there anybody else that has any questions about active listening or being, finding courteous or any of our classroom norms"
354,46,In simulation?
355,0,"So, uh, we will begin simulation. Hey. Hello."
355,1,Hi.
355,2,Hi. How was your vacation?
355,3,"Oh, my vacation was great."
355,4,Cool.
355,5,Cool. Thank much for asking.
355,6,"No problem, no problem. Cool. I had a good one too. <affirmative>. Okay. So, yeah. Um, oh, wait, hold on. Will sit up. Well, I'm, I'm sitting up. Yeah, but you know, she's trying to talk. You're slouching."
355,7,"Okay, everyone, so before we begin, I wanted to go over some norms and roles that we will have in our classrooms. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, the first one is will be respectful."
355,8,Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.
355,9,"Um, and that means using kind words, um, to each other. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And we're going to use listening to listen to other people. We're going to be kind to each other and if we have something to say, we will raise our hands. Okay. And last but not least, getting"
355,10,A text.
355,11,"So be ourselves. Um,"
355,12,"Okay. Cool. Sounds good. Yeah. Kind of tired. Alright. It's gonna be back. Sorry. Um, I have a, I have a norm that we can think of. No."
355,13,"Yes. Jayla,"
355,14,"Maybe? Um, no sleeping in class. That'd be a good one. Oh, I'm awake down"
355,15,Sleeping.
355,16,"I'm awake. Sorry. I, I'm sorry. I stayed up way too late last night. I, uh, <laugh>, but I'm here. I'm here now. I'm awake."
355,17,"Hello. We can work on some strategies on how we can go to bed earlier, if that will help you be awake and aware in class."
355,18,"Oh, yes. I'm gonna go's at a trampoline place. Yeah. Yeah. It's at three. Three."
355,19,"Remember, if we have something to say, we can raise our hands."
355,20,"Oh, okay. Um hmm."
355,21,"Yes, Emily?"
355,22,"Yeah. Maybe a, a good, um, a good normally be like, uh, showing up on time and being like ready to work and, uh, just having like your homework done or your reading and just being ready to participate."
355,23,"So yes, Emily, that's a wonderful idea. I think that's something that we can all learn from and something that we can all do. Thank you for sharing."
355,24,"Hmm. Um hmm. Yes, Carlos. Well, you know, I was gonna say to everybody that I, that I finally saw the first Ironman movie and, uh, wow. It was so good. Um, I'm gonna late to the party on that, but anyway, just wanted everyone to know. If you're not into superheroes, it doesn't matter cause I'm not but that movie. Wow. So,"
355,25,Okay.
355,26,"Um, there you go."
355,27,Stay on task.
355,28,"Okay. Um,"
355,29,"Carlos, can you think of a norm that we could add to the list?"
355,30,"Oh, sure. Um, maybe no, uh, no eating in class. That'd be good."
355,31,"Okay. Yeah, no eating unless it is snack time or anything like that. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, yes, Emily,"
355,32,"I have one too. Uh, I think, um, being, uh, mindful of people's space and you know, their stuff, so don't take other people's things, um, unless you ask them to borrow it and, uh, no running stuff like that. Yeah."
355,33,"Yes. That's, that's a wonderful idea. I think that shows that we care for our classmates, that we discuss them and their things."
355,34,"We have homework. Nina? No. Okay. Sorry. Hi. Sorry. I thought we had homework. I was wrong. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, whoops. Say about it. Yeah. Okay. Okay. This is, um, this is boring. Why are we doing this?"
355,35,"We're doing this because it's important that we establish these roles from the beginning. Uhhuh <affirmative> that later on. Um, we don't have any misunderstandings."
355,36,"Okay. That, that, that makes a lot of sense actually. Um, yeah. Yeah. Uh, I think another norm that would be really good would be maybe like to participate or to make sure like you participate one time every day, at least. Um, I don't know, just be end simulation. Okay. Well, thank."
356,0,Begin simulation.
356,1,Okay. Hi class. So the norm.
356,2,Hi.
356,3,How you doing?
356,4,Not
356,5,Bad. How are you?
356,6,I'm good.
356,7,Good. How is your vacation?
356,8,I was good. How was your vacation?
356,9,"Oh, I loved it. I got to spend a lot of time with my family."
356,10,That's good to hear.
356,11,"Oh, cousins are annoying, but honestly I don't mind so much."
356,12,"Okay, so today we're gonna go over some classroom norms. I have five norms down that I hope will be able, that I hope will be able to use to get through the school year. Um, the first norm is to be respectful and kind to your fellow parents. Inside"
356,13,Will
356,14,Sit up.
356,15,"I am sitting up. Hey, attention. I am paying attention."
356,16,Hey guys. Hey
356,17,"Guys. You never pay attention. Hmm? Yes, I'm paying attention."
356,18,"Hey, let's focus up, up there. Can I get every, can I get everybody's attention? Okay. The second, the second classroom will be to keep an open mind when hearing him engaging with others."
356,19,"Oh,"
356,20,My mom's sending me a text.
356,21,"Hey, can we save the text message? Oh,"
356,22,No.
356,23,Hmm.
356,24,"Oh, sure. Yeah. No, I'm just worried that I forgot something at home."
356,25,Is everything okay?
356,26,I think so. Thanks.
356,27,"No problem. The third one will be to, um, the third number is to understand that it's okay to make mistakes in the classroom. Okay. Will, is everything okay?"
356,28,What?
356,29,Is everything okay?
356,30,"Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry. No, I just, I just got tired or I guess I stayed up too late last night."
356,31,Oh.
356,32,How are you feeling today?
356,33,Not bad. Not bad. Thanks.
356,34,"No,"
356,35,"For the fourth classroom, normal be to complete all assignments. And if and when you need hope to just go."
356,36,Are you coming to my birthday party later? Of course. I wouldn't
356,37,Miss it.
356,38,"Hey, Hey J can we talk about this at a later time? Hmm."
356,39,"Oh yeah, sure. Sorry, I, I just got excited."
356,40,"No problem. Your birthday's coming up, huh?"
356,41,Yeah. Yeah. It's my party's today after school.
356,42,"I'm happy to hear that. Um, after we go through this last norm, we can probably talk about it at a later time. Is that okay?"
356,43,"Yeah, that sounds good. Thanks."
356,44,"And then the final norm that I have for the class is if and when you need help, just feel free to let me know."
356,45,"Oh, oh, I forgot to say I saw Iron Man over break. It was amazing. I wasn't allowed to see Iron Man before, but now my dad thinks I'm old enough. I just, I just wanted to share that."
356,46,"Okay. That sounds really interesting. Let's just get through the last class Norm, and then we can feel free to talk about Trevor. Is that okay?"
356,47,"Yeah. Yeah. I have got a lot of opinions about the Marvel movies. I'll, I'll save 'em for you."
356,48,"Thank you. Okay, so the last and final norm is if you, if and when you need help, feel free to let me know. Do you guys have any questions? Any questions? Yes, Emily?"
356,49,"Um, well, I was wondering, do you think that we could suggest, um, being, being, being respectful of people's things? Yes. As a norm?"
356,50,"Yes. We can add that to our first norm about being respectful and kind. I, we can add that."
356,51,Thanks.
356,52,No problem. Any other questions?
356,53,"Oh, crap. Mina. Mina. Did we have a book report due today? No. No, I don't think so. Are you sure? Yes. Well, I remember everything."
356,54,"Hey, class. Any other questions? Yeah, any questions or you guys understand the classroom norms?"
356,55,"I think I understand, honestly, this is a little boring. Why are we doing this again?"
356,56,"Because we wanna create a safe and supportive classroom environment where all our parents can feel, heard and listen to. Wouldn't you wanna be in a classroom where you feel like you can be yourself and do what would you do? Do what you like"
356,57,End simulation.
357,0,Begin simulation.
357,1,"Am I supposed to,"
357,2,"Oh, oops."
357,3,"Say the norm. Oh, okay. So I just go. Okay, everybody, welcome back. Hi. Hello."
357,4,Welcome back. How was your vacation?
357,5,It was great. How was yours?
357,6,"Oh, it was great. Thanks. Yeah, I spent a lot of time with my cousins <laugh>."
357,7,"I'm glad to hear that. Well, now that everyone's back, I just wanted to go over a few ground rules and just make sure that we all remember our norms. Um, for this class,"
357,8,We'll sit up. I'm sitting up. Pay attention. I'm paying attention.
357,9,"Will Mina, are you guys okay?"
357,10,"Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm great. Cute."
357,11,"All right. Well, one of our norms that I think we need to talk about again, is to treat others how we treat others with respect and kindness. Um, another thing that I wanted to go over was following directions. Um,"
357,12,"Oops. Oh,"
357,13,"Um, oops. Is someone on their phone? Mom"
357,14,"Is sending me a text. Yeah. No, my mom is sending me a, I wonder if I forgot something at home."
357,15,Emily. Now's not the time to be on our phones.
357,16,"Sure, sure. Sorry."
357,17,"And that's probably another one of the rules that we should go over whenever. Um, we're in the middle of class, we need to make sure that we're not going on our phones to be Will, are you paying attention?"
357,18,"What, what? Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry. I, I think I just, I don't know, stayed up too late last night."
357,19,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. But whenever we're in a lesson that everyone should be following directions and listening to the teacher not going on our phones. Um, and when I Oh,"
357,20,"Oh, Emily, are you coming My birthday party tomorrow,"
357,21,"Jayla? Yeah,"
357,22,Of course. I wouldn't
357,23,Listen right now.
357,24,"Oh, sorry. Sorry."
357,25,"That was something I was just gonna say. We shouldn't, whenever someone's talking, we shouldn't interrupt. And especially you can talk about those things at a more appropriate time."
357,26,Sure. Yeah.
357,27,"Okay. And another thing is, um, I, if you guys ever need anything, I'm here for you. So just remember that if you ever need to talk or you have any problems, that's another thing I wanted to remind everyone on. So, again, the norms should be that we should treat others with kindness and respect. Um, not be calling me."
357,28,"Oh, I completely forgot. I saw Iron Man for the first time over the break. I meant to lead with that when you asked about vacation. It was on the tip of my tongue. It was so good. I gotta tell you, I haven't seen that before. My dad finally let me worth it. Emily, worth it."
357,29,That's
357,30,"That's great, Carlos."
357,31,"Carlos, that's great. But like I had said earlier, I know that everyone's very excited about their vacations and what they got to do over break, but this is not the time. Now that we're on our a different discussion, this isn't the time to be talking about that. But it was great that you saw that and that you shared."
357,32,Thanks. Sorry.
357,33,"It's all right. So, again, I know this, it's a very exciting time. We just came back from break and it's kind of hard to get back into the routine of things, but we need to make sure that everyone's following the directions. Yes. Emily."
357,34,"Hi. I wanted to say something. Perhaps we could be more respectful of each other's space, like time."
357,35,"Okay. I think that's a great idea. Emily, thank you for sharing and raising your hand."
357,36,"Oh, crap. Mina. Did, did we have a book report due today? I don't think so. Are you sure? Yeah, yeah. No, I, I think I wrote it down and then, oh, crap. And then I forgot what I wrote down. Well, why don't you look and read it? Yeah."
357,37,I don't think we should be saying those type of words in class. And
357,38,This is boring. Why are we doing this again?
357,39,"Alright, everyone, it's important that we go over these norms so that we can have a productive and oh,"
357,40,End simulation.
358,0,Perfect.
358,1,So good. Let's begin. Simulation.
358,2,"Hello class. How are we? I hope we had a great break. Um, since we are back, I did wanna remind us about our classroom expectation."
358,3,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. How was your break?"
358,4,"My break was wonderful. Thank you so much for asking. Okay, so let's listen. You're welcome. Welcome. Thank you. Let's listen to our expectations. So we want to remember to be respectful to ourselves, our peers, and our teacher. And we think about what that looks like. That looks like waiting for others to stop talking. For us to talk."
358,5,You'll sit up. I am sitting up. Pay attention.
358,6,Let's think about that one more time. So that
358,7,"Is, I am paying attention. Hmm."
358,8,Thank you Will. So that means listening to others and waiting for our turn to talk. And it also is not getting up from our desk while some we're doing a different activity. And we also wanna raise our hand if we need help or have a question.
358,9,"Oh,"
358,10,"Emily, remember we had to turn our phones off during class?"
358,11,"Oh, yes, yes. Sorry. And my mom sent me a text."
358,12,No worries. But please put it on silence for next time.
358,13,Got it.
358,14,That was everyone's break. <laugh>.
358,15,Mine was great.
358,16,"What did you do, Jayla?"
358,17,"I hung out a lot with my cousins and we played some games and Oh, we went to the trampoline park."
358,18,"That sounds like so much fun. What was your favorite part of your,"
358,19,"Are you coming to my birthday party at the trampoline park? Yeah, of course. I wouldn't miss it."
358,20,"Jayla, that was a great idea. Let's give the turn for Emily to talk. Emily, how was your break?"
358,21,"Um, my break was good. Yeah, thanks."
358,22,Of course. How about you Carlos? How was your break? Thank you for staying quiet and respectful. That's really nice.
358,23,"You're you're welcome. My break was, um, I was gonna say something,"
358,24,Huh? That's okay. Do you want me to get back to you?
358,25,"Yeah, yeah, that, thanks."
358,26,"Okay, of course. Let's give Mina a turn and talk. Well, well remember you're gonna be next. Mina, how was your break?"
358,27,"Um, my break was fine. Thanks. I think Jayla has a question."
358,28,Jayla? Yes. What's your question?
358,29,"Yeah, I just, I wondered if, since we're talking about, about classroom norms, it would be good for us to focus as a norm."
358,30,"Yes. That's a great, that's a great norm. Of course, we always do wanna focus in class and classroom instruction. Can you tell me what focusing looks like?"
358,31,"Um, it means <laugh> not falling asleep."
358,32,"That's good. Why don't we go to Will, will. What's a good norm that you think when a full classroom is talking? We're sharing ideas and the teacher's talking. What do you think we"
358,33,"Oh, I remember. I remember I, I watched, um, Ironman over break. That's what I did. Yeah, it was awesome."
358,34,"Great. Carlos, however, I wasn't going to you yet, but let's give will a turn a talk about norms and then I'll get back to you. And I would love to hear about that movie."
358,35,"Uh, will. Yes."
358,36,"Um, what did you think is a good way for all of us to focus and stay with our attention and our active listening skills?"
358,37,"What do you think? I think we should be respectful of each other's spaces,"
358,38,"Emily, however, will was talking. We don't wanna be disrespectful to will."
358,39,Hi. Sorry.
358,40,That's okay.
358,41,"Oh crap. Mina. Did, did we have a book report due today? No. Will, I don't think so. Are you sure? Yes. I would've written it down. You sure? I didn't like, forget to write it down. Positive. I never forget anything."
358,42,"And tell us the norms so that we all,"
358,43,This is boring. Why are we doing this again?
358,44,"Yes. Since it seems like some of our friends are having a little bit of a tough time trying to remember what the norms were when someone's talking, we do have to remind that one more time. However, you're doing a really good job, Jayla, whenever you're sitting respectfully."
358,45,Thanks.
358,46,"We wanna remember to stay quiet and if we do have a question, time for talking will be right after the instructions are given. Right? So we were going over class norms and we did have a chance for everybody to share"
358,47,And simulation
358,48,"<laugh>,"
358,49,Thanks for your time.
359,0,Begin simulation.
359,1,Okay. Class. So since we're back from break. All right. Yeah.
359,2,How was your break
359,3,"As up front? We're gonna talk in a second. So I just wanna remind us, um, of the things we might have forgotten, overbreak. So I wanna remind us that we're all one big family here. So keep in mind how we treat our family members."
359,4,"Excuse me real quick. How, how was your break?"
359,5,"One second. We're gonna talk to each other in a minute. So we are going to treat our friends the way we've liked to be treated. So that can look like being kind, using nice words, looking out for one another. And there's another aspect of that."
359,6,I'm sitting up.
359,7,"Eyes up here. No,"
359,8,You're not. Pay attention. Thank you.
359,9,Respecting
359,10,"Our clients, paying attention,"
359,11,"Materials and each other. Now that I've gotten a chance to go over our norms, now you have a chance to talk about break."
359,12,Oh.
359,13,All right. Let's put that phone away please.
359,14,"Sorry. Yeah, my, um, my mom is sending me a text. I wonder if I forgot anything at home."
359,15,That's okay. We can take a look at it in a minute. Does anyone wanna share how their break was?
359,16,"Hmm. Oh, I, I, um, what was I gonna say? My break was great. Thanks for asking."
359,17,Awesome. What did you do?
359,18,"Well, I hung out a lot with my cousins. They came to visit. They're pretty fun."
359,19,"Did anyone else hang out with their family or cousins? Carlos, did you remember what you were gonna say? Oh,"
359,20,"Emily, are you coming to my birthday party tomorrow?"
359,21,"Hey, let's do that for during recess. Okay."
359,22,I wouldn't forget it. Sure. But don't worry. Jayla.
359,23,"Carlos, did you remember what you were gonna say about your break?"
359,24,"Oh, I think it was gonna be something about"
359,25,That's okay.
359,26,"I'll just, I know. I can't remember"
359,27,One more minute. Will.
359,28,Huh?
359,29,Do you wanna share about your break?
359,30,"Oh, sorry, I just got a little tired. I think i's stayed up too late last night."
359,31,"Did you wanna share about your break Orm? I can share while you think,"
359,32,"Uh, uh, I don't, I don't know. Okay. My break was perfect. Thank you."
359,33,Jayla. Did you have one more thing to add?
359,34,"Yeah, yeah. We were, um, we were talking about norms, right? And I thought that maybe we could, um, agree to, to focus as a norm and not interrupt each other."
359,35,"I think that's a great idea. I feel like there's been a lot of interrupting and I know that that is not how we treat our friends. So I will,"
359,36,"Oh, I remember it was Iron Man. I watched Iron Man Overbreak. I haven't seen that before. It was so good. Emily. You'd love it."
359,37,"Emily, have you seen an Ironman? Sure."
359,38,"Um, no I haven't, but I probably would like it. Thanks, Carlos."
359,39,"Yes. Thank you, Carlos. Well, let's circle back to you. Did you wanna share about your break?"
359,40,"Uh, I don't, I don't, I don't know."
359,41,You don't know? That's okay. Emily.
359,42,"Yeah. Um, Jayla had mentioned, um, res, um, um, classroom norms and I was wondering if we could also establish a respecting each other norm. Not interrupting, but also not touching each other's stuff."
359,43,"Great. That's what I talked about a little bit earlier, respecting our classroom materials and each other. So that's a great idea. Oh,"
359,44,"I forgot the book. Mina, did we have a book report today? No. Will be quiet."
359,45,Are you? We don't
359,46,Have a book. Are you sure? Yes. She just said we don't have a book report. Geez. Okay. Thanks.
359,47,All right. Does anyone else have anything they wanted to share for our norms? Anything they can remember? This
359,48,"Is a little boring. Why are we doing this again,"
359,49,We're a review because not all of our friends remember.
359,50,Okay.
359,51,Can anyone think of
359,52,And simulation? Thank you for your.
360,0,Begin simulation.
360,1,"Morning, everyone."
360,2,Good morning.
360,3,How's everyone doing today after we got back today?
360,4,Great. How was your vacation?
360,5,It was good. I really enjoyed myself. I got to hang out with friends. It was very fun.
360,6,Cool. Me too. Me too.
360,7,"I love it. I love to hear it. But since we've been out of the classroom for so long, I figured it might be good to refresh ourselves on what it's like being in our classroom."
360,8,Well sit up.
360,9,He's fine. Don't worry about it.
360,10,"Yeah, I am fine sitting up. Go"
360,11,"<laugh>. But I would like to go over really quick some of our classroom norms. So remember when we ask questions, it's always very important that we don't talk over each other, that we raise our hands so I can get to all of you one at a time. Remember?"
360,12,"Oh,"
360,13,Hmm. Everything okay?
360,14,"Oh, yeah. My, my mom's sending me a text."
360,15,"All right. That's okay for today because it's been a while and I'm sure it's important. But remember, we also Yeah. Have a policy of phones in the classroom."
360,16,"Oh, right, right. Sorry. I just wonder if I forgot something. Hmm,"
360,17,"You're fine. If it seems urgent, feel free to go check it. We're just going over some stuff right now. Remember also that when we are talking, when one of one of us is talking, that means me or one of you that the rest of us are silent and attentive. Right? It's very important that we show respect to other people while they're talking."
360,18,"Oh, come my birthday party. Yeah, of course. It's tomorrow. Tomorrow after school."
360,19,"Remember what I just said while I'm talking? You guys need to be attentive. Now, I'm sure the birthday party is fun on topic of conversation, but when can you talk about it later? Right?"
360,20,Awesome. Got it.
360,21,"Will, are you asleep?"
360,22,What? No.
360,23,"No. Kind looks like you are, bud."
360,24,"Sorry. I, oh, I guess I just didn't get much sleep last night."
360,25,"It's fine. It's nothing I haven't seen before. It's early in the morning, but remember, try and be awake and aware when I'm talking, Jayla. Yes."
360,26,"Yeah. I wondered if I could suggest, um, a norm."
360,27,Of course. Always
360,28,No cell phones.
360,29,I would agree with that. Yes. I think that's something we could absolutely make a norm. Yes.
360,30,"Oh, crap. Wait. I was gonna tell you guys, I saw Ironman over break. It was amazing. I've never seen it before. My dad didn't let me. It was well worth the wait. Holy crowd."
360,31,"You wanna tell us a little bit about that, Carlos, before is yours and we'll all,"
360,32,"Yeah. Yeah. Uh, actually,"
360,33,Yes. Emily?
360,34,"Uh, yes. I thought that, uh, I could suggest it a norm too."
360,35,"Well, let's wait one second while Carlos tells us about his experience over break, and then you can suggest our norm. Okay."
360,36,"Well, I just wanna be respectful of other people's space."
360,37,"I agree with that, and we'll talk more about it in a second. Carlos,"
360,38,"What, what was the question?"
360,39,Tell us about what happened over break.
360,40,"What, well, what stop poking me. I'm, I'm just worried. Do we have a book report due today? I don't know. Check your planner. How do you not know? You know everything."
360,41,"Well, you know, we have"
360,42,One of these days proud
360,43,"To talk and No, for the record, definitely don't have a book report due today."
360,44,"Oh, thank goodness. <laugh>,"
360,45,This
360,46,Is boring. Why are we doing this again?
360,47,"Because, well, it may seem boring. It never feels good when someone talks over you. Right? Never feels good to be disrespected in the, the classroom. Yeah. Think about for a second. Okay. How you might feel if I spent, oh, it's over."
360,48,End simulation.
