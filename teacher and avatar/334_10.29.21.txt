Speaker 1 (00:00):
Uh, so it's time for your session to start and we will begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:10):
Hi class. Did everyone have a great break?

Speaker 3 (00:13):
Oh, yeah. Oh yeah. How about you?

Speaker 2 (00:15):
I had a great break. Excellent. And so now that we are back in the classroom, we should think about what are some ways that we show that we can be respectful to others in the classroom and also ourselves? What are, what could that look like? Raise your hand if you have an answer.

Speaker 3 (00:35):
Um, oh, sit up. I am sitting up. Nina. Nina paying attention. Oh, yep. Sorry. Getting, really paying attention. Sorry

Speaker 2 (00:49):
About that. Yeah. Nina, I heard you talking, but I didn't see you Raise your hand. Do you have an idea to share about how we respectful to our classmates?

Speaker 3 (00:57):
Oh, sure. Um, I think showing up on time is usually a good way to start up the day,

Speaker 2 (01:03):
Showing up and being on time. Do we just show up however we want? We can just like run into the classroom. Oh, no. Do we do that?

Speaker 3 (01:13):
Sorry, my mom is texting me. Oh, dear. Wonder, forgot something at home. I'm

Speaker 2 (01:20):
Emily. One moment, Emily.

Speaker 3 (01:24):
Sorry. Sorry about that. My mom was just texting me. <laugh>. Sorry. That's

Speaker 2 (01:31):
Okay. Remember, our phones are not out or we're having a discussion. Okay. Go ahead and put that away. Will I see you nodding? Do you have another idea?

Speaker 3 (01:42):
So, how we, um, I, sorry. I'm sorry. I just, woo, just woke up. I just, uh, I I stayed up way too late last night. Oh, I'm sorry. Um, uh, whew. Too

Speaker 2 (01:56):
Much YouTube. I can also come back you if you want a moment to

Speaker 3 (01:58):
Make if you could. Yeah. No, but I'm awake now. I'm awake now. So, um, yeah. Uh, maybe no cell phones would be a good rule. I don't know.

Speaker 2 (02:07):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, that could be one way we show that we are being respectful to our

Speaker 3 (02:16):
Jayla. Need to go. It should be fun. Oh, yep. I'm sorry. I was just telling, uh, Emily about a birthday party today. Sorry about that.

Speaker 2 (02:23):
Sorry. Yep. Jayla, do you have an idea of mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Some ways that we can be respectful to our peers. To our classmates?

Speaker 3 (02:31):
Yeah. Um, I think letting one person talk at a time maybe is getting mm-hmm. <affirmative>, like, you know, hearing people's thoughts and being respectful of people's opinions and stuff.

Speaker 2 (02:42):
Oh yeah. So that we're listening when someone else is speaking and that means that we're not talking while someone else is speaking because if you're talking and you're trying to listen to someone talk, it's really hard to do more than one thing.

Speaker 3 (02:56):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

Speaker 2 (02:58):
Yep. Okay. Does anyone else have ideas of what it could look like to be respectful?

Speaker 3 (03:05):
Uh hmm. Oh, oh, I wanted to say, I finally got to see the first Ironman movie. I do know. I've never seen it, so I, I highly recommend Carlos to everybody. Um,

Speaker 2 (03:16):
So excited that, can you tell me about that after we have our discussion?

Speaker 3 (03:20):
Okay, I can do that. Not a problem. Right? Beth? A problem.

Speaker 2 (03:22):
Sounds great. Do you have any ideas for how we can be responsible to our classmates? If not, I can come back to you.

Speaker 3 (03:28):
Oh, no, no. I, I can, uh, I think, uh, maybe we said showing up on time. I think, uh, I guess, you know, always being prepared and ready to work, you know, like having your homework done and your reading and stuff, so mm-hmm. <affirmative> every day.

Speaker 2 (03:44):
Yeah. So having your homework done, having done your readings, maybe showing up, maybe you have all your materials ready. Emily, what do you think?

Speaker 3 (03:55):
Um, I think a good one would be like being respectful of space, you know, like, um, not running or touching other people's stuff if it's not yours, things like that.

Speaker 2 (04:06):
Yeah. And that could be dangerous sometimes.

Speaker 3 (04:10):
Oh. Did we have a book report? No. Well, we didn't. I thought we had a book report too.

Speaker 2 (04:17):
Will, do you have a question?

Speaker 3 (04:19):
Yes. Oh, I, I, I just, uh, I thought that there was, um, I thought there was a book report due today, but I guess, I guess I was mistaken I guess since it was vacation we didn't have like, any assignments and stuff, so. Yep. That's ok. Sorry, I was just nervous. I might have missed something <laugh>.

Speaker 2 (04:33):
Sorry. And that's okay. But we'll talk about that later, will. Okay.

Speaker 3 (04:36):
Okay. Okay.

Speaker 2 (04:38):
Any other ideas? So I heard we were gonna come to class prepared. Yeah, we're gonna homework done.

Speaker 3 (04:44):
This is, this is boring. Um, why, why are we doing this again? I'm sorry.

Speaker 2 (04:51):
Because sometimes when we're gone for a really long time, it's hard to remember the things that we're used to doing and things that are normal. Yep.

Speaker 3 (04:59):
I get it. I'm sorry. Just checking. Cool. Yeah.

Speaker 2 (05:04):
All right. Other ideas or other classroom norms that you guys remember from Hmm. Before the break.

Speaker 1 (05:11):
Alright, well, hey, you, uh, are done with that simulation, so thank you for completing.
