Speaker 1 (00:10):

Speaker 2 (00:12):

Speaker 2 (00:25):
Nice to meet you all. Welcome back from summer vacation.

Speaker 1 (00:30):
Thanks.

Speaker 2 (00:32):
Today we're gonna be going over our classroom norms. Does anybody know what classroom norms are?

Speaker 1 (00:41):
Uh, yeah.

Speaker 2 (00:43):
Yes, Carlos?

Speaker 1 (00:45):
Yeah, those are the rules. Um, I have one. I would like just suggest a norm of no cell phone.

Speaker 2 (00:52):
I like that one. Thank you for sharing that. Anyone else?

Speaker 1 (01:00):
Well sit up, pay attention. Im paying attention,

Speaker 2 (01:08):
Nina.

Speaker 1 (01:11):
Yeah.

Speaker 2 (01:12):
Can you please pay attention?

Speaker 3 (01:14):
Yep.

Speaker 2 (01:15):
Thank you. So the two classroom norms that I would like to go over are respecting each other and respecting ourselves. So Nina just gave us a great example of how we can respect each other.

Speaker 1 (01:30):
My mom is sending me a text. I wonder. Wonderful. Forgot

Speaker 3 (01:33):
Something.

Speaker 2 (01:37):
Emily, if there's something you wanna share?

Speaker 1 (01:40):
Text. Oh, my mom just sent me a text.

Speaker 2 (01:44):
Oh, I think Carlos had a great idea of not having our phones.

Speaker 3 (01:48):
Oh,

Speaker 2 (01:49):
Do you mind putting your phone away?

Speaker 3 (01:51):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (01:52):
Thank you. So, like I said, classroom norms are going to be,

Speaker 1 (02:03):
We stayed up too late last night.

Speaker 2 (02:05):
Sleepy. Well, are you a little sleepy?

Speaker 3 (02:07):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Yeah.

Speaker 2 (02:09):
Yeah. Well, I'm sure you can get some rest when you go home, but right now we're in the classroom. Okay.

Speaker 1 (02:16):
Okay. Okay. I'm awake.

Speaker 2 (02:17):
Thank you. Does anyone else have any class norms that they would like to propose?

Speaker 1 (02:23):
Hey, Emily, are you gonna come to my uh, jump today after school? Yes. Is,

Speaker 2 (02:37):
I think that would be defined as not respecting each other as one of our classroom norms.

Speaker 1 (02:45):
Okay. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:46):
Thank you. Does anyone have any idea ideas? Jayla, do you have any ideas for a classroom norm?

Speaker 1 (02:56):
Um, yeah. Everybody has to, um, respect everybody else's time when they're talking.

Speaker 2 (03:03):
I like that. Hmm. So when I'm talking, we should respect what I'm saying, right?

Speaker 1 (03:09):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>?

Speaker 2 (03:10):
Yes. Thank you.

Speaker 1 (03:12):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

Speaker 2 (03:14):
Anyone else?

Speaker 1 (03:17):
Um, guys, I saw the, um, the new, um, Ironman movie this summer. It was so good. Did you guys see it? Marvel movies. Emily, did you see it?

Speaker 2 (03:28):
Hmm. Thank you so much for sharing that. I, I really like that you're so interested in that, but we're talking about our classroom norms. Would you like anything else to share?

Speaker 1 (03:38):
Uh, no. Thank you.

Speaker 2 (03:39):
Okay. Will Nina, Emily?

Speaker 1 (03:44):
Um, well, everybody should be prepared, um, for school. Yeah. Like, have other stuff with them when they get to school.

Speaker 2 (03:52):
And being prepared also means getting a good night's rest. So make sure that you're not sleeping in class and you're sleeping when you're at home at night and coming to school. Ready to learn.

Speaker 1 (04:06):
Yes.

Speaker 2 (04:07):
Nina, Emily?

Speaker 1 (04:10):
Yeah.

Speaker 2 (04:11):
Do you have any classroom norms you'd like to share?

Speaker 1 (04:18):
Um, I don't think so.

Speaker 2 (04:21):
Okay. Emily, anything?

Speaker 1 (04:25):
Hey, um, Nina, do we have a book report due today? I dunno. Will

Speaker 2 (04:30):
Will Nina.

Speaker 1 (04:32):
Well, uh, yeah, but we might have one. I'm not sure. I may have forgot that. Yeah,

Speaker 2 (04:38):
Right. Now's not the time to talk about that. Remember, one of our, one of our norms is that we're respecting each other and we're not gonna talk when the teacher is talking, or our classmates are sharing something.

Speaker 1 (04:52):
Oh, this is, this is so boring. Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (04:58):
Well, classroom norms are very important to make our space and each other comfortable and feel safe.

Speaker 1 (05:06):
All right.

Speaker 2 (05:06):
So, although it may seem kind of boring, it is really important. Okay. We wanna respect everybody and we wanna respect our classroom.

Speaker 1 (05:15):
Okay. Okay. And simulation. Thank you for your time completing that.
