Speaker 3 (00:10):
Hey Clarissa.

Speaker 2 (00:11):
Hello. How are you all doing today?

Speaker 3 (00:14):
Good.

Speaker 2 (00:15):
Good, good. Okay. So first we are going to review some expectations today. Can anyone remind me of an expectation we have for our classroom?

Speaker 3 (00:29):
I got

Speaker 2 (00:29):
One. Yeah, Jayla, go ahead.

Speaker 3 (00:32):
Gotta raise your hand before you talk.

Speaker 2 (00:34):
Gotta raise your hand before you talk. That's a great one. I appreciate that. You just exemplified that right now. When you were thinking of something to say and raised your hand first everyone show me what it looks like to raise your hand.

Speaker 3 (00:48):
Okay. So if you wanna,

Speaker 2 (00:51):
Hey,

Speaker 3 (00:52):
I'll, yeah,

Speaker 2 (00:57):
Can you show me what it looks like? Raise. Raise

Speaker 3 (00:58):
Your hand. Hi.

Speaker 1 (01:01):
What's that?

Speaker 2 (01:03):
Can you think of an expectation we have for our class?

Speaker 3 (01:10):
We're talking when the teacher's

Speaker 2 (01:12):
Talking. That's a good one. Will do you remember that one also?

Speaker 3 (01:17):
Oh,

Speaker 2 (01:22):
I appreciate that Carlos has been sitting silently this whole time while we've been talking. So you're right. We have raise your hand when you'd like to talk

Speaker 3 (01:32):
Text.

Speaker 2 (01:34):
Emily, do you have an idea of a one more, um, expectation we have.

Speaker 3 (01:39):
Oh, I can tell you all the norms for, um, the whole year teacher. Cause I remember our list from last year. Do you want me to go through them? Um, it was, yeah,

Speaker 2 (01:52):
Let's see if Emily has an idea and maybe she can phone a friend if she can't think of

Speaker 1 (01:56):
Anything.

Speaker 3 (02:01):
How prepared for class.

Speaker 2 (02:03):
That is an awesome one. So we have raise your hand when you'd like to speak. Don't talk when the teacher's talking and come prepared for class. Those are awesome. Carlos, did you have anything you wanted to add to that?

Speaker 3 (02:16):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (02:45):
You're right. Mina. Let's remember that the expectation we just talked about. Not talking while the teacher's talking.

Speaker 3 (02:53):
Okay. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:54):
That's okay. Thank you very much. All right. So that was a good review. Does anyone wanna show me, um, with their hand in the air?

Speaker 3 (03:03):
So I wanna make sure that my science project is okay. So, um, can I present my topic to you right now so I can get going on? Got it. Recess?

Speaker 2 (03:12):
Yeah, we just talked about how we wanna raise our hand when we have something to say. So I'm wondering what you all did this weekend, but if you'd like to share, I'd like you to show me what we just talked about and it raise your hand if you'd like to speak. Does anyone wanna share what they did this weekend? No. Will go ahead.
