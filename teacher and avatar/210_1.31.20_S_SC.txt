Speaker 1 (00:05):
Good. Begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:09):
Good afternoon class. How are we doing today?

Speaker 3 (00:12):
Good,

Speaker 2 (00:12):
How are you? I'm fine, thank you. It's great to have all of you with me today. Uh, we are a couple weeks into the semester, but I thought it would be a good idea for us to review some of our classroom norms. Um, so I wanna get right into it. So I wanna remind you guys that one of our first classroom norms is to raise a quiet hand when you have a question or something to contribute. Um, why do you think we decided that that was a good classroom Norm to have

Speaker 3 (00:41):
Answer? I don't wanna answer. I don't have an answer. Come on. You need to participate, mark, come

Speaker 2 (00:49):
On. Well, you know, as I hear someone talking, um, while we're waiting for someone to raise a by hand, that will take me into one of our other classroom rooms, which is to be respectful of each other. And that would mean to not talk when someone else is talking or to just give someone a couple minutes to get their thoughts together before they decide to contribute.

Speaker 3 (01:11):
Sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:12):
That's okay. Text. Oh yeah. Another one of our classrooms, like I just said, is about being respectful and one of the ways that we can be respectful to each other in our class, but, um, our teachers is by not using our phones in class, Emily. Okay.

Speaker 3 (01:27):
Gotcha. But

Speaker 2 (01:28):
Anyway, yeah. Thank you so much. I appreciate that. Sorry. Oh, I'm so glad that you use your kind words cuz that is one of our, our other classroom norms is using kind words. And so,

Speaker 3 (01:38):
Oh, I was, I wanted to ask you to cue, are we

Speaker 2 (01:41):
Carlos, are we

Speaker 3 (01:42):
Gonna have a, um, like a,

Speaker 2 (01:45):
What, what was one of the first classroom norms that we talked about just now?

Speaker 3 (01:49):
Oh, I'm sorry. You know, so I'm kinda a, like a, a science junkie.

Speaker 2 (01:54):
I I get that. Carlos, I would love to hear what you have to say, but I'd like for you to raise a quiet hand so we can demonstrate those classroom norms. Okay.

Speaker 3 (02:02):
I'll stop.

Speaker 2 (02:03):
I don't want you to stop. I would just like for you to raise a quiet hand and then I can call on you. Gotcha.

Speaker 3 (02:07):
Gotcha. Lena, where

Speaker 2 (02:11):
Do you go? Carlos? Carlos? What do you have to contribute?

Speaker 3 (02:15):
Uh, yeah, I was just saying, um, science. I love science.

Speaker 2 (02:19):
Oh, I do. I love science as well. Why do you love science so much, Carlos? Yes.

Speaker 3 (02:23):
Hey, stop telling me what to do. Okay. Can you look

Speaker 2 (02:27):
Embarrassing? Will, yes. Can you remind me of one of the classroom norms that we just talked about?

Speaker 3 (02:32):
Yes. Um, to be respectful

Speaker 2 (02:36):
And how can we show Carlos that we are being respectful of him right now?

Speaker 3 (02:39):
Uh, to, to not, um, interrupt.

Speaker 2 (02:42):
Wonderful. Thank you. So can we give Carlos the flow one more time so you can tell us why he loves science so much,

Speaker 3 (02:48):
Much appreciate it. Um, no, so I was just thinking, um, I dunno if we're like, uh, gonna be doing a lot of science in here or what are you, what are your, what are your thoughts?

Speaker 2 (03:01):
We will definitely be addressing some science in this classroom, but for right now, and I just wanted to make sure that everybody was on the same page, just so I thought we should Gotcha. Take a couple minutes to talk about our classroom.

Speaker 3 (03:11):
What about, uh, like science fairs? Like would you be that as like an idea going forward?

Speaker 2 (03:17):
That would be wonderful. Carlos. Does anyone else have any contributions that they wanna make to this?

Speaker 3 (03:23):
Uh, yeah. Um, oh, well, sorry.

Speaker 2 (03:29):
Yes, Julia?

Speaker 3 (03:31):
Yeah. Um, I was thinking maybe like texting is not the best idea. Like, is it

Speaker 2 (03:38):
Norm? I like that. That's wonderful. Why do you think texting would not be a good idea in class?

Speaker 3 (03:43):
Um, it could be like pretty disruptive actually.

Speaker 2 (03:46):
That is, and so that ties into our respect for one another, right? Right. We wanna make sure that when someone is talking, we're giving them undivided attention and

Speaker 3 (03:55):
We're, this is, um, this is boring. Why are we doing this? Do you think

Speaker 2 (03:59):
We're doing this so that we can proceed in a orderly fashion, offer our classes and just to make sure that we're all on the same page going forward.

Speaker 3 (04:07):
Okay. Gotcha.

Speaker 2 (04:08):
Yeah. Anybody else? All right, great. So now that we're all in a group, I'm sorry Hannah, did you have something you wanted to contribute? Oh, no, not at all. Okay, wonderful. Now that we're all on the same page in terms of our class norms, we can proceed to our next lesson. Okay.

Speaker 3 (04:22):
Pay attention. Will what? Sorry. It's just,

Speaker 2 (04:29):
Does anyone wanna tell me, uh, about something fun that they learned in their previous class?

Speaker 3 (04:33):
Uh, well, not making fun of me. Gosh.

Speaker 2 (04:39):
Will, is there something that you'd like to contribute or is there someone that's not being respectful of you

Speaker 3 (04:44):

Speaker 2 (04:48):
