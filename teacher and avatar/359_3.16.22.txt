Speaker 1 (00:02):
Begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:13):
Okay. Class. So since we're back from break. All right. Yeah.

Speaker 1 (00:19):
How was your break

Speaker 2 (00:20):
As up front? We're gonna talk in a second. So I just wanna remind us, um, of the things we might have forgotten, overbreak. So I wanna remind us that we're all one big family here. So keep in mind how we treat our family members.

Speaker 1 (00:33):
Excuse me real quick. How, how was your break?

Speaker 2 (00:37):
One second. We're gonna talk to each other in a minute. So we are going to treat our friends the way we've liked to be treated. So that can look like being kind, using nice words, looking out for one another. And there's another aspect of that.

Speaker 1 (00:53):
I'm sitting up.

Speaker 2 (00:55):
Eyes up here. No,

Speaker 1 (00:55):
You're not. Pay attention. Thank you.

Speaker 2 (00:57):
Respecting

Speaker 1 (00:58):
Our clients, paying attention,

Speaker 2 (00:59):
Materials and each other. Now that I've gotten a chance to go over our norms, now you have a chance to talk about break.

Speaker 1 (01:15):
Oh.

Speaker 2 (01:18):
All right. Let's put that phone away please.

Speaker 1 (01:20):
Sorry. Yeah, my, um, my mom is sending me a text. I wonder if I forgot anything at home.

Speaker 2 (01:26):
That's okay. We can take a look at it in a minute. Does anyone wanna share how their break was?

Speaker 1 (01:35):
Hmm. Oh, I, I, um, what was I gonna say? My break was great. Thanks for asking.

Speaker 2 (01:52):
Awesome. What did you do?

Speaker 1 (01:55):
Well, I hung out a lot with my cousins. They came to visit. They're pretty fun.

Speaker 2 (02:00):
Did anyone else hang out with their family or cousins? Carlos, did you remember what you were gonna say? Oh,

Speaker 1 (02:09):
Emily, are you coming to my birthday party tomorrow?

Speaker 2 (02:12):
Hey, let's do that for during recess. Okay.

Speaker 1 (02:15):
I wouldn't forget it. Sure. But don't worry. Jayla.

Speaker 2 (02:22):
Carlos, did you remember what you were gonna say about your break?

Speaker 1 (02:27):
Oh, I think it was gonna be something about

Speaker 2 (02:35):
That's okay.

Speaker 1 (02:36):
I'll just, I know. I can't remember

Speaker 2 (02:37):
One more minute. Will.

Speaker 1 (02:41):
Huh?

Speaker 2 (02:42):
Do you wanna share about your break?

Speaker 1 (02:45):
Oh, sorry, I just got a little tired. I think i's stayed up too late last night.

Speaker 2 (02:53):
Did you wanna share about your break Orm? I can share while you think,

Speaker 1 (03:01):
Uh, uh, I don't, I don't know. Okay. My break was perfect. Thank you.

Speaker 2 (03:08):
Jayla. Did you have one more thing to add?

Speaker 1 (03:11):
Yeah, yeah. We were, um, we were talking about norms, right? And I thought that maybe we could, um, agree to, to focus as a norm and not interrupt each other.

Speaker 2 (03:24):
I think that's a great idea. I feel like there's been a lot of interrupting and I know that that is not how we treat our friends. So I will,

Speaker 1 (03:32):
Oh, I remember it was Iron Man. I watched Iron Man Overbreak. I haven't seen that before. It was so good. Emily. You'd love it.

Speaker 2 (03:42):
Emily, have you seen an Ironman? Sure.

Speaker 1 (03:45):
Um, no I haven't, but I probably would like it. Thanks, Carlos.

Speaker 2 (03:51):
Yes. Thank you, Carlos. Well, let's circle back to you. Did you wanna share about your break?

Speaker 1 (03:59):
Uh, I don't, I don't, I don't know.

Speaker 2 (04:02):
You don't know? That's okay. Emily.

Speaker 1 (04:08):
Yeah. Um, Jayla had mentioned, um, res, um, um, classroom norms and I was wondering if we could also establish a respecting each other norm. Not interrupting, but also not touching each other's stuff.

Speaker 2 (04:28):
Great. That's what I talked about a little bit earlier, respecting our classroom materials and each other. So that's a great idea. Oh,

Speaker 1 (04:33):
I forgot the book. Mina, did we have a book report today? No. Will be quiet.

Speaker 2 (04:40):
Are you? We don't

Speaker 1 (04:41):
Have a book. Are you sure? Yes. She just said we don't have a book report. Geez. Okay. Thanks.

Speaker 2 (04:52):
All right. Does anyone else have anything they wanted to share for our norms? Anything they can remember? This

Speaker 1 (04:57):
Is a little boring. Why are we doing this again,

Speaker 2 (05:01):
We're a review because not all of our friends remember.

Speaker 1 (05:06):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (05:08):
Can anyone think of

Speaker 3 (05:13):
And simulation? Thank you for your.
