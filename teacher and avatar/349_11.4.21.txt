Speaker 1 (00:00):
Your session to begin. Okay. Uh, so we will begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:07):
All right. Good morning class. It's been a while. Hi. Saw you all. How is everyone?

Speaker 3 (00:12):
It was good. How we yours?

Speaker 2 (00:14):
It was great. Yeah. I did some traveling, but I'm really happy to be back cuz we have Nice, a lot of very interesting things to learn. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, before we start, let's review our class expectations. Let's start with our class routine. So remember beginning of the school year, he all became very familiar with our class routine In the morning, well

Speaker 3 (00:37):
Sit up

Speaker 2 (00:38):
Nina.

Speaker 3 (00:42):
Sorry.

Speaker 2 (00:43):
It's okay. Our class routine involves coming into the class quietly. You can talk with your friends, but don't yell. We're at a voice level of one. Maybe a whisper or, or soft talking tone. And you unpack your things and look at the morning message. Another thing that I, I think we should review is we raise our hands when we wanna say something. I know sometimes it's really hard to to to wait your turn if you have something to say. But just remember to raise your hand and I'll, I'll definitely call on you.

Speaker 3 (01:15):
Oh no, I'm getting a text. Oh no, that's something at home,

Speaker 2 (01:20):
Emily. Yes. Emily, do you remember our expectation having to do with technology?

Speaker 3 (01:27):
Um, no. Well, sort of, my mom texted and said I left my, my lunch at home, but I put the phone away,

Speaker 2 (01:34):
So. Okay. That's right. You put the phone away. Unless it's an emergency, then you, it needs to be put away. And even if there is an emergency, you would the, your parent would contact me and I would contact you. Hey Will,

Speaker 3 (01:49):
Yeah. Will I off? Oh dear. I'm sorry. You know what? I stayed up too late last night and I, I'm sorry, I'm awake now.

Speaker 2 (01:57):
That's okay. That's understandable. If you ever feel really sleepy or you need a, a little wiggle break, just raise your hand and we're going quiet corner and get some water and sit down, wake up a little bit.

Speaker 3 (02:10):
Are you gonna go to the birthday party? Um, yeah. Is it at

Speaker 2 (02:14):
The, do you remember Yeah. The difference between our learning time and our social time?

Speaker 3 (02:20):
Oh yeah. I was just checking in with, um, Emily about, uh, a birthday party later.

Speaker 2 (02:27):
So Yeah, I could do that

Speaker 3 (02:28):
Later. No, babe.

Speaker 2 (02:29):
Exactly. You could do that during recess or lunch, but not right now. Okay,

Speaker 3 (02:34):
Sure.

Speaker 2 (02:34):
Great. And remember when we are in the classroom and wherever we go, we use respectful words to each other. So please be kind to your friends cuz we want this to be kind and fun learning environment. Jayla, thanks for raising your hand. What do you have to share?

Speaker 3 (02:50):
Sure. Oh, I was thinking, um, maybe a good, a good rule would also be, you know, showing up on time and just always being ready, you know, to work, um, on whatever we're doing at the beginning of class.

Speaker 2 (03:03):
Yeah, I totally agree. I think that's a great idea. Show up on time. Ready to work with all your supplies.

Speaker 3 (03:10):
Oh, oh, you know what I wanted to mention, um, everybody, I finally got to see the first Ironman movie. I'm not a big superhero

Speaker 2 (03:17):
Fan. Carlos.

Speaker 3 (03:19):
It's so great, Carlos.

Speaker 2 (03:20):
We'll have a time later to share what we did over break, but right now we're viewing our experts.

Speaker 3 (03:24):
Okay, I gotcha. Okay. Sorry about

Speaker 2 (03:27):
That. Uh, I'd love to hear about that later.

Speaker 3 (03:29):
Okay. Okay,

Speaker 2 (03:31):
<laugh>, so we use respectful words no interrupting. And make sure you have all your material materials ready. And if you forgot some something, just let me know and we'll figure it out. Emily, do you have something to share?

Speaker 3 (03:43):
Yeah. Um, I was thinking maybe one would be a good one would be like, um, respecting people's space and not, you know, touching things that aren't yours and, you know, uh, running or doing anything. Right. Crazy.

Speaker 2 (04:03):
Use calm body when we're in the classroom. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So running, no. Touching other things without

Speaker 3 (04:08):
Permission. Do any homework. Do we have to do

Speaker 2 (04:11):
Hey, will, do you have a question?

Speaker 3 (04:12):
Yeah. Oh yeah. I, we don't have like any homework today, do we? I didn't know. No,

Speaker 2 (04:18):
I didn't assign homework over our

Speaker 3 (04:20):
Break. Okay. That nap threw me off. I'm sorry. <laugh>. It's okay. Okay, got it.

Speaker 2 (04:25):
Yeah, as I was saying, music, calm body when we're in the classroom, so make sure you save your running and all your, um, big activities and playing out for recess when we go outside,

Speaker 3 (04:38):
This is boring. Why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (04:42):
We're doing this because sometimes it takes a few days for us to get back into the routine. Mm-hmm.

Speaker 3 (04:48):
But once

Speaker 2 (04:49):
We're routine and we won't, all these things will come as so naturally we won't really have to remind you. Gotcha. Else.

Speaker 3 (04:54):
That's why. Okay, I gotcha.

Speaker 2 (04:57):
Are there any other class expectations that you remember us using from the beginning of the year?

Speaker 3 (05:04):
Hmm, maybe. Uh, alright.
