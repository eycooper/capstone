Speaker 1 (00:03):
Are you ready? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. And start simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:10):
Good morning boys and girls.

Speaker 3 (00:13):
Hey,

Speaker 2 (00:15):
Today I wanted to talk to you all about um, something called behavioral expectations. Does anyone know what behavioral expectations mean? I mean, by that you can go,

Speaker 3 (00:28):
You mean like, um, raising our hands and stuff like that? Teacher?

Speaker 2 (00:33):
Yeah, Emily, that's a great expectation that we could have in our classrooms. So behavioral expectations are things as the teacher that they're sort of like rules that as the teacher, I would expect for you all to be doing. Um, the first one, actually, Emily, excuse me. Sorry. I don't

Speaker 3 (00:58):
Hey,

Speaker 2 (00:58):
Nina.

Speaker 3 (01:00):
Nina,

Speaker 2 (01:01):
Please stop talking right now. So, okay. Our first behavioral expectation I wanted to talk to you all about is raising your hand for permission to speak. Emily kind of hit the note on that one. So we wanna, why might we wanna raise our hands to

Speaker 3 (01:17):
Speak text?

Speaker 2 (01:20):
Emily, please put your phone away.

Speaker 3 (01:24):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (01:25):
Why might we wanna raise our hands when we, um, to speak in class? Anyone have any ideas?

Speaker 3 (01:35):
Oh, I know how we raise our hands, teacher. Um, but um, I gotta, I can keep all the notes, um, about the norms that we're doing. Cause um, we did this last year in school. Do you want me to write down everything for you?

Speaker 2 (01:49):
That would, that would be wonderful. Carlos. You can go ahead and do that. You can do that quietly. That would be wonderful. Actually.

Speaker 3 (01:55):
So was last year. Notes have to have to raise our hands cause um, not everybody gets to learn.

Speaker 2 (02:07):
Exactly. So Carlos did a great job answering that. So we wanna raise our hands so everyone has a turn to speak and you can hear other people when they're trying to talk.

Speaker 3 (02:18):
Will

Speaker 2 (02:18):
Did you have something to ask there? I can. Nina, please stop talking.

Speaker 3 (02:27):
No, she keeps bothering me. She keeps talking

Speaker 2 (02:31):
To me. Nina, please stop talking and we wanna make sure everyone focuses so we're raising our hands, um, for permission to speak. So the second expectation that I have for you all this year is to come prepared to class. Does anyone have any ideas of what coming prepared looks like?

Speaker 3 (02:54):
Uh, oh, I raised my

Speaker 2 (02:55):
Hand. Perfect. Jayla, I love that you raised your hand.

Speaker 3 (03:00):
Uh, it means that you come with a planner and your homework and all the stuff to get started.

Speaker 2 (03:07):
Exactly. So you wanna be coming with your, are

Speaker 3 (03:09):
We gonna talk about the science fair today? Cause I wanted go you before. So project started. Can we see?

Speaker 2 (03:19):
So not right now. Carlos, we're gonna focus on this and if you wanna keep taking notes, that'd be great, but we're gonna do that quietly. Thank you so much though. So, but I love how prepared you are, um, in doing that. So, for instance, we wanna make sure that we have our notes when we're gonna be taking notes in class. We wanna make sure we have our notebook, we wanna make sure we have our pencil, bring our homework to class. So Jayla got a lot of those. That's fantastic. And the third expectation I'm gonna have for you all is that you treat others how you want to be treated.

Speaker 3 (03:54):
Why are we doing this? This is so boring.

Speaker 2 (03:57):
So, Jayla, that's a great question. So we're, we wanna set behavioral expectations so that we know every day what we should and should not be doing. So the third one, treat others how you wanna be treated. How is a way that you think you would wanna be treated in class? What is something that,

Speaker 3 (04:15):
Um, everybody kind to each other? Yes,

Speaker 2 (04:18):
That's a great one. Everyone should be kind to one another. Does anyone else have any ways that they wanna be treated

Speaker 3 (04:25):
In class? Please shut off. I don't wanna talk

Speaker 2 (04:28):
To Hey, this

Speaker 3 (04:29):
Anymore. Well, I

Speaker 2 (04:30):
Can help you

Speaker 3 (04:32):
Be quiet.

Speaker 2 (04:33):
Nina. Please stop talking. So what is, what is the way you wanna be treated? Nina? What is something important to you?

Speaker 4 (04:42):
Uh,

Speaker 3 (04:47):
Ice. I guess. Ice.

Speaker 2 (04:51):
Ice being nice. That's uhhuh, that's a really important one. We wanna treat our classmates kindly. Um, that's super important. Will, how about you? What is something important to you that your classmates and how your classmates treat

Speaker 3 (05:06):
You? Respect for my own business.

Speaker 2 (05:10):
Respect for your own business and simulation.
