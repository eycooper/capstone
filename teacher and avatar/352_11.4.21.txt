Speaker 1 (00:00):
Uh, it is time for your session to begin. So we will begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:08):
Hi. Good morning everybody.

Speaker 3 (00:10):
Hey there.

Speaker 2 (00:12):
Um, I heard you guys have been on a break recently.

Speaker 3 (00:15):
Oh yeah. How was your break?

Speaker 2 (00:17):
Um, it was very nice. I got to be, have a restful break. How was everyone elses?

Speaker 3 (00:22):
Sweet. Oh, had a great time. It was good. Great.

Speaker 2 (00:25):
All right. So I know that after we've had a break, it's sometimes hard to remember all the things that we've put in place. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, um, when we were back in school, it's almost been, well

Speaker 3 (00:38):
Sit up.

Speaker 2 (00:39):
Alright. So tell me, well, Nina, can, can either of you tell me one of our classroom rules that we had before break?

Speaker 3 (00:49):
Um, I think one would be, uh, no cell phones in class.

Speaker 2 (00:56):
Definitely. And do you have mm-hmm. <affirmative>, do we, do we ever talk about a reason why we really don't wanna be having our cell phones out during class?

Speaker 3 (01:04):
Uh, it's disruptive, I think.

Speaker 2 (01:06):
Definitely. And it doesn't allow us to listen to our other friends and,

Speaker 3 (01:11):
Oh, no,

Speaker 2 (01:13):
You're what they're saying. Um, Emily, do you have anything you remember?

Speaker 3 (01:17):
Sorry, my mom is texting me. I'm just trying. Oh,

Speaker 2 (01:21):
Emily, so what did, what did we just go over? Yeah,

Speaker 3 (01:24):
We just said that. No phones. I was just get rid of her. So,

Speaker 2 (01:29):
Um, if it's important, um, you can just raise your hand and ask me and, um, and deal with it, um, together later. Does anyone else have a classroom norm that they wanna go over that they remember we were using?

Speaker 3 (01:43):
Um hmm. Oh,

Speaker 2 (01:46):
I remember one. Um, I remember that We, when we want something. Okay. We're gonna raise our hand for attention.

Speaker 3 (01:53):
Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2 (01:53):
<affirmative>. Well, are you tired from your break?

Speaker 3 (01:55):
Whoa, <laugh>. Oh no. Oh, sorry. I was just, I just went off into Dreamland for a second. Yeah, I, I stayed up too late last night, but I'm, yeah, I'm here now. Sorry about that.

Speaker 2 (02:06):
It's okay. Um, we're all trying to get back on track after break. So what I was saying

Speaker 3 (02:10):
Is birthday party,

Speaker 2 (02:12):
Um,

Speaker 3 (02:12):
Should be fun, please. Yeah.

Speaker 2 (02:15):
So a good example would be to make sure that when someone else is talking, Emily, when someone else is talking, um, we wanna give them our full attention. That would be one of our classroom norms so we can all hear each other, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, and I remember that we had one to raise our hands and we have something to say. So if you'd like to share something with the art group, you're more than welcome to raise your hand and share. Yeah. Jayla.

Speaker 3 (02:38):
Yeah, I was thinking maybe, um, a good norm would be just, you know, showing up on time and, and like, being ready to, to work or, or, or do whatever, like homework we have to do or whatever assignment for the day and just gotta be ready to participate.

Speaker 2 (02:53):
So I love that. Just show up ready to, um mm-hmm. <affirmative> participate. Yeah. And on time is really important. It's a good skill.

Speaker 3 (03:00):
Okay. I think. Yeah.

Speaker 2 (03:02):
Yeah. Thank you so much. Um,

Speaker 3 (03:06):
Oh, um, I just wanted everyone to know,

Speaker 2 (03:09):
To give us an idea.

Speaker 3 (03:10):
Oh, sure, sure. I just wanted everyone to know that I, that I did get to see the, the first Ironman movie after all, and I thought it was fantastic and I just wanted to put that out there. Um, if anyone's, I

Speaker 2 (03:20):
Love that you're sharing, hopefully you guys can share more of your stories during recess or some free time. Okay. Um, do we have any other classroom norms that we wanna go over? Um, raise your hand if you have a thought. Yeah, yeah, Emily.

Speaker 3 (03:33):
So, uh, I think like, um, maybe like being respectful of people's space and like, internet, like touching someone's things who aren't, that aren't yours or, or like running or, you know, pushing people, you know, just being respectful with your body.

Speaker 2 (03:56):
So being respectful with your body to keep us safe as well as to just make sure that we're being respectful of other people's things. I love that. That was one of the classroom ones that I had on my list as well.

Speaker 3 (04:07):
<laugh>. Oh, did we have any homework? Mina, did

Speaker 2 (04:09):
We have, well, if you have something you wanna share, you can definitely raise your hand and share with us.

Speaker 3 (04:13):
Oh. Oh, you know, I was just, I was asking Nina, um, what, what if we had like any homework or a book report,

Speaker 2 (04:21):
Anybody? Oh, well that's definitely something you could have raised your hand and we can cover that later. But Emily was talking about being safe with our bodies. Can you think of a time where it would be important to, um, keep our hands to itself?

Speaker 3 (04:32):
Yeah. Like when we're maybe transitioning from, you know, class to class or going to the lunchroom and stuff. Like, just to be

Speaker 2 (04:38):
Definitely, that's a great example.

Speaker 3 (04:41):
This is,

Speaker 2 (04:41):
Or on the playground.

Speaker 3 (04:42):
This is flooring. Why are, why are we doing this

Speaker 2 (04:45):
Again? Um, does anyone know why we would go over our classroom norms after the break?

Speaker 3 (04:49):
Oh, just a, like a refresher, you know? Yeah,

Speaker 2 (04:53):
Definitely. Yeah. A refresher because all these keep us from Oh, staying safe, having a, um, learning environment where everybody can learn, right. Can have a great rest of our school year.

Speaker 3 (05:04):
I hear that. That makes sense. Yeah,

Speaker 2 (05:06):
That's a good question cuz it is important.

Speaker 3 (05:09):
Alright. End.
