Speaker 1 (00:01):
Begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:05):
Hey everybody. How's it going today?

Speaker 1 (00:08):
Good, good.

Speaker 2 (00:09):
How was your break? Did you have a nice time off?

Speaker 1 (00:13):
Yeah. Pretty good. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Good. Good. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

Speaker 2 (00:17):
That's great to hear. Yeah, I had a nice time away too. It was very relaxing.

Speaker 1 (00:21):
Good.

Speaker 2 (00:23):
So we're back in class and we've had some time away from each other. So, um, before we get started with our day, I just wanna spend a few minutes talking about, um, you know, some of the things that we've been working on the first part of this year, and just making sure we're following rules for safety and courtesy.

Speaker 1 (00:41):
Oh, we should definitely have a, a rule that we don't have any cell phones.

Speaker 2 (00:45):
No cell phones. I think that's a great rule. That's a very good rule. Thanks Carlos. Anyone else? Um, if you can raise your hand and tell me

Speaker 1 (00:53):
Another rule. Sit up straight. Pay attention. I'm Nina. Leave me alone. No, but you're not listening. I'm listening. Nina, leave me

Speaker 2 (01:04):
Alone. Nina. Nina, can I see your eyes up here? Nina? Hey, how are you? Can you come up with a, can you come up with a rule that we should all try to follow?

Speaker 1 (01:17):
We should all pay attention.

Speaker 2 (01:19):
Yeah, I think that is a great rule. Let's pay attention. And, um, related to that, um, will, can you think of any another I

Speaker 1 (01:29):
Got a text. Carlos. I got a text from

Speaker 2 (01:32):
My Oh, Emily. Emily. I'd love to hear from Will, can you pause for a moment?

Speaker 1 (01:37):
My mom sent me a text. Maybe I forgot something at home.

Speaker 2 (01:41):
Well, I think Carlos already shared a great rule, which was no cell phones in class. But also I want to hear from Will. So let's, let's all listen to Will

Speaker 1 (01:54):
They stayed up too late last night? I'm

Speaker 2 (01:57):
Tired. Oh, I was up late too. Will, but we all have to be ready for school and be ready to learn. All right. Well, I would love to share a rule that I have, and that is one around safety. So as we're moving around the classroom, that means no running or no pushing. Does that sound like a good rule? We can all follow

Speaker 1 (02:14):
Up. I'm like, are you gonna come to jump tomorrow? Um,

Speaker 2 (02:23):
Jayla? Yeah. Did you hear what I was I did you hear? I was just talking. Did you hear the rule that I shared?

Speaker 1 (02:30):
Uh, no. I'm sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:33):
No. Well, I'll say it once more, but I want you to listen carefully. Okay?

Speaker 1 (02:38):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (02:39):
So as we're moving around the room, one thing that's really important is to be safe. So no pushing or running around the room.

Speaker 1 (02:46):
Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2 (02:46):
<affirmative>. Okay. What's another rule that is really good for us to consider? What about if you need to leave for any reason, what would you think would be good? Yeah, Jayla.

Speaker 1 (03:01):
Um, I was just gonna say, um, well, you should raise your hand before you leave the classroom, but I was just gonna say, I think normal would be for like everybody to focus.

Speaker 2 (03:12):
Yeah. Excellent. Um, I love raising your hand.

Speaker 1 (03:15):
I just saw the Iron Man movie. It was so, I love good, I love Marvel comics and movies.

Speaker 2 (03:23):
I love them too, Carlos. But let's, let's stay on this for a few more minutes. Okay. Can I, can I have your help on that?

Speaker 1 (03:30):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yes.

Speaker 2 (03:31):
So raising your hand is very good. Now, if you need to leave the room, maybe if you need to go to the bathroom or get some water, definitely. You have to let me know before you leave, right?

Speaker 1 (03:41):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>

Speaker 2 (03:43):
Good?

Speaker 1 (03:44):
Yeah. Um, yeah.

Speaker 2 (03:46):
So let's, let's just review quickly. We have a, a couple of good rules. Carlos, I think you told us no cell phones, correct?

Speaker 1 (03:52):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

Speaker 2 (03:54):
Okay. And Jayla, you said raise your hand to get attention, right?

Speaker 1 (04:00):
Nina? Mina. Do we have a book report? Do

Speaker 2 (04:05):
Will, will,

Speaker 1 (04:07):
Yeah. Let's clarify

Speaker 2 (04:08):
Our book report later. Okay?

Speaker 1 (04:11):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (04:12):
All right. And if you have a question, you can ask me. Okay?

Speaker 1 (04:16):
Oh, that's okay. Okay.

Speaker 2 (04:17):
Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you. All right, so we talked about safety, we talked about, um, raising our hands. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And one more really important rule is just the level of voice that we use throughout the day. When we're indoors, we have to use a quieter voice. And when we're outdoor,

Speaker 1 (04:37):
Oh, this is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (04:42):
Well, Jayla, it's, I know it might not be super exciting, but guess what? These rules are really helpful for all of us so that we can work together. Cause there's a lot of people, there's a lot of us in this classroom, so we have to work together. Right?

Speaker 1 (04:55):
Hey, but I know. Okay. It's best way.

Speaker 2 (04:58):
Thank you. I really appreciate it. So the last thing I was saying is we all have to use the re Oh,

Speaker 1 (05:07):
Okay.
