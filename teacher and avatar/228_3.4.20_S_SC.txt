Speaker 1 (00:05):
We start simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:09):
Hi everybody, I'm Ms. Murphy.

Speaker 1 (00:11):
Hey.

Speaker 2 (00:12):
Hi. Hi there. So I just wanted to review some of our expectations in our classroom today. So, uh, the first one I'm thinking of is raising your hand. That's a pretty big one, wouldn't you say? Why is that important? That we raise our hand in the classroom. Yeah, Jayla.

Speaker 1 (00:33):
Oh, it helps. I think everybody, um, maintain order.

Speaker 2 (00:37):
Yeah, totally. What else? Well,

Speaker 1 (00:40):
Well, why didn't you raise your hand? We've been working on, on you being a little bit, you know, more demonstrative.

Speaker 2 (00:49):
Mina, do you have something you're saying over there?

Speaker 1 (00:51):
Me alone? Oh, sorry. We're just trying to get will out of his shell.

Speaker 2 (00:57):
Oh, well that's nice. Nice for you to think of him, but yeah. Well, I think, are you good to go? Will you don't have anything you wanna add?

Speaker 1 (01:05):
No. Okay.

Speaker 2 (01:06):
That's

Speaker 1 (01:06):
Alright. Embarrassed.

Speaker 2 (01:07):
No, you're fine. So, um, something that's also important.

Speaker 1 (01:12):
Sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:14):
You're good. Something that's also important is being quiet when others are speaking. Sorry,

Speaker 1 (01:19):
Text.

Speaker 2 (01:20):
All right. Yeah, Emily, we'll have to put that away. So, thank you. So when others are speaking, we should be quiet and that makes a lot of sense. Why is that? Anybody have an idea?

Speaker 1 (01:33):
Well, I think, uh, oh. Oh, oh, oh.

Speaker 2 (01:39):
Remember to raise

Speaker 1 (01:40):
Your hand. Just talk about, um, really quickly. Um, I had this idea. Do, do we maybe wanna have a, like a sort of a, like a superhero discussion at all? Um, I'd really love to make them up. So I was just seeing anybody was

Speaker 2 (01:57):
Interested that that's a cool idea, but not for right now. Okay, Carlos. Okay.

Speaker 1 (02:00):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (02:01):
Yes. We'll talk about that another time.

Speaker 1 (02:03):
Sorry for not raising my hand here.

Speaker 2 (02:05):
Thank you for saying that. Yep. That's an important thing to raise your hand. Um, and you know, sometimes if you have a question that you just wanna check with a friend really quick. Well, did

Speaker 1 (02:16):
You take

Speaker 2 (02:16):
My pencil? It's easier just to raise your hand and then everyone can hear the answer. I didn't take pencil.

Speaker 1 (02:22):
We'll take my pencil. I think I know. Well,

Speaker 2 (02:26):
We'll have to, we'll have to address that in a little bit. Okay. Oh, so we still have one more thing we're we're talking about. Okay. Which is okay. Our third expectation is that we have safe bodies in the classroom. What does that mean, you think? To be safe with how your body is in the classroom? Yeah. Jail.

Speaker 1 (02:44):
Um, um, I think, you know, be respectful of people's space and, uh, no running. Don't take people's in still.

Speaker 2 (02:53):
Yeah. Those are great points.

Speaker 1 (02:56):
Stuff like

Speaker 2 (02:57):
That. Yes, exactly. Yeah. Running is just for outside or at pe Yep. And inside the classroom we should be walking or sometimes if we have like a little dance, we'll

Speaker 1 (03:09):
Do so. Oh, oh, oh. Oh. Are you gonna run the science fair this year? Cause I heard, I heard you're gonna do that. Am I totally wrong

Speaker 2 (03:15):
About that? Carlos? Carlos, what are you forgetting right now? Forgetting to go.

Speaker 1 (03:20):
Alrighty.

Speaker 2 (03:20):
Raising your hand. Yep. I'll talk about the sides for later. Okay.

Speaker 1 (03:24):
Okay, good. There you go. I'll not forget next time.

Speaker 2 (03:26):
Thank you. Good. Um, and then how's, how's everybody's, um, week been going? Uh, like how was your morning? This morning?

Speaker 1 (03:39):
What's that? I'm sorry.

Speaker 2 (03:41):
How was your morning? This morning? What's something that you did while you were home? Did anybody read me cool books lately?

Speaker 1 (03:53):
Oh, what is boring? Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (03:58):

Speaker 2 (04:10):

Well, yeah, not a thief. They're

Speaker 2 (04:35):
Just Hey guys. Humiliating

Speaker 1 (04:36):
Me. Actively humiliating me in class. Well,

Speaker 2 (04:39):
Hey, will and Mina. Yeah, Jayla was trying to share something and one of our expectations is to listen and, and to be quiet while others are speaking. And if you have something that you wanna share, you can raise your hand.

Speaker 1 (04:53):
Sorry. Sorry,

Speaker 2 (04:54):
Jayla. So Jayla, can you tell me about, uh, the biographies you you've been reading?
