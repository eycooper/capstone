Speaker 1 (00:03):
Begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:06):
Hi class.

Speaker 1 (00:08):
Hi,

Speaker 2 (00:09):
I'm Ms. [inaudible] and I'm so excited to be your teacher this year.

Speaker 1 (00:13):
Hi there.

Speaker 2 (00:15):
I just wanted I first, um, I wanted to, um, talk about some classroom rules.

Speaker 1 (00:22):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (00:23):
So the first one I wanna go over is to use kind words. Why do you think we should use kind words?

Speaker 1 (00:34):
Um, well, you took my pen. Take your pen. No, Nina. No, it's not here. You took it. Yeah.

Speaker 2 (00:44):
Sorry. Let's, we're talking about classroom rules, so we, we don't even need our pens right now. Okay.

Speaker 1 (00:50):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (00:50):
So why Nina? Why, why is it important to use kind words?

Speaker 1 (00:55):
Um, well, I think that'll help us, um, work together better.

Speaker 2 (01:01):
Yes, of course. Yeah. We wanna be kind to each other because we feel it, it will make us feel good about ourselves.

Speaker 1 (01:10):
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:18):
Um, so the second one I want to make sure we remember is to, to be safe in the classroom. What does be safe mean?

Speaker 1 (01:29):
Um, be like respectful of people's space, right? Oh, I meant to say, I'm sorry. But, um, they're working on a screenplay, uh, with these like superheroes I really like, and I was just thinking if anybody wanted to workshop it. Um, I've got several copies on me, so if anyone wants to do a read through, just Paula.

Speaker 2 (01:51):
Okay. I, your idea sounds awesome, Carlos, but we are, we are talking about our classroom rules right now. Okay. There will be another time to have those conversations. So why is it important to keep safe in the classroom?

Speaker 1 (02:07):
Well, so people take your pen. I didn't take your pen.

Speaker 2 (02:12):
Stop. So we wanna make sure, Mina, I just want me, we wanna make sure that we have safe hands and safe feet in the classroom so that everyone is comfortable and we are in a comfortable and safe place to learn,

Speaker 1 (02:31):
Okay?

Speaker 2 (02:32):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And the next one is follow directions. So it's important that we follow directions in class. So what does that mean, Jayla? I haven't heard from you.

Speaker 1 (02:43):
Yeah. Um, well maybe like just, uh, follow directions, just sort of, you know, if we have an assignment, we should do it right. Um, and, you know, have it done on time and do our best. All that stuff. Yeah.

Speaker 2 (02:59):
Cool. Yeah. Anyone else?

Speaker 1 (03:03):
Uh oh. Are you gonna be in charge of the science fair this year? Because I have some amazing ideas and I didn't know if you like, had any info on that.

Speaker 2 (03:15):
Carlos, I am so excited to hear your amazing ideas, but cool. Right now we're talking about classroom roles. Um, so I wanna hear from you. What, what, what does following directions look like in the classroom?

Speaker 1 (03:31):
Um, well, like if you tell us to be quiet, probably be quiet. Yeah. Although sometimes

Speaker 2 (03:38):
When the teacher told you something to do to make sure you follow her direction. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> great. Yeah.

Speaker 1 (03:44):
And if you're working in a group, you know, like work together, right? Stuff

Speaker 2 (03:48):
Like that. I really, I really like that.

Speaker 1 (03:50):
This is boring. So it's Jayla, why are we doing this? This

Speaker 2 (03:56):
Jayla? Yeah.

Speaker 1 (03:57):
This is boring. Why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (04:00):
Well, it's very important that we're in school to to, to have a, a good place to learn and for us to feel comfortable in the classroom because this is where we're gonna be the majority of our day. And I wanna make sure that everyone is, it, it, this is feels comfortable and, and it's gonna be a, a fun place to learn. Kick me and we can

Speaker 1 (04:25):
Have kicking you because you stole my pen. I didn't steal it. Stop telling me that. Well,

Speaker 2 (04:32):
You're Nina

Speaker 1 (04:34):
Will. Nice. What are you doing? I'm just calling things the way I see

Speaker 2 (04:40):
Nina and Will.

Speaker 1 (04:42):
Yep.

Speaker 2 (04:43):
It is not okay to, it is not okay to kick. We need to remember to keep our, our hands and feet to ourselves. Okay. Um, so will you need to make sure you to return the pen? And honestly, we to right now we're working on cla we're talking about classroom rules. Yeah. So we shouldn't have anything out right now. Okay? Okay.

Speaker 1 (05:06):

Speaker 2 (05:08):
Okay. And.
