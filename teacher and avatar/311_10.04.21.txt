Speaker 2 (00:05):
Hi class. Um, today we're

Speaker 1 (00:08):
Gonna, hi.

Speaker 2 (00:10):
Today we're going to be talking about our classroom norms. Um, the first thing we wanna make sure we're doing in our classroom is being kind. Do all of you know what that looks like in a classroom?

Speaker 1 (00:26):
Um, yeah, I do. And I also think we should have a norm of no cell phones.

Speaker 2 (00:32):
Oh, that's a great idea, Carlos. Thank you. I agree. I think we should have no cell phones in our classroom. <laugh>. Um, does anyone else have any norms they want to add?

Speaker 1 (00:45):
Sit up. I am sitting up. Mina, you need to pay to pay attention to the teacher. William. I'm paying attention. Mina. Shush. Stop. My gosh. Why keep me about it?

Speaker 2 (01:03):
Um, could you guys, um, sorry, could you guys, um, let's get back to our conversation. Um, Mina and Will, do you have any classroom norms you wanna add to the list?

Speaker 1 (01:19):
Oh my gosh. I'm, is

Speaker 2 (01:28):
Everything okay?

Speaker 1 (01:31):
Yeah, I just got a text from my mom.

Speaker 2 (01:36):
Aw. Um, was it something important?

Speaker 1 (01:40):
No ma'am. It's okay.

Speaker 2 (01:43):
Oh, okay. Great. Thank you. Um, so if that's the case, would you mind, um, putting your phone on silent for now and putting it away?

Speaker 1 (01:51):
Tired. I stayed up too late last night.

Speaker 2 (01:57):
Oh, well, I'm sorry. You're tired. I know. That's rough. Um, maybe we can take a quick break after we finish podcast.

Speaker 1 (02:05):
Okay. Next one. I, I'm like, sorry, sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:09):
Okay, thank you. Um, so the next storm is to be respectful of everyone in the classroom.

Speaker 1 (02:15):
Are you gonna jump today after school? Are you gonna go, Emily? I dunno. Um, I gotta check with my mom. I'm coming to your birthday party. Oh, cool you guys. Yeah, but I, let's go to jump today guys. What, please.

Speaker 2 (02:30):
Hi students. Um, would you guys mind just holding off on other conversations until we finish Assumption? Mm-hmm.

Speaker 1 (02:37):
<affirmative>? Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2 (02:37):
<affirmative>? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Thank you. Yep. So that kind of brings us to the next norm. Um, listen and try to, um, be quiet when other people are speaking. Oh, thank you for raising your hand. Jayla, do you have a question?

Speaker 1 (02:52):
Yes. Nope. I got one though. I got a norm that like, everybody needs to focus.

Speaker 2 (02:59):
That's a great one. Thank you for that. We'll add that to the list.

Speaker 1 (03:03):
Speaking of focus, I saw the new Marvel movies, um, this summer. I saw 'em each like twice. Has anybody seen them? They're awesome. Anybody? Hello? Did you see new Marvel movies?

Speaker 2 (03:18):
The Marvel movies are awesome. Um, but let's talk about the Marvel movies later. Let's stay on track here and finish. Um, any other norms that anyone wants to add? No. Um, yes. Emily,

Speaker 1 (03:41):
Did we say, um, respect other people's space for one of our norms?

Speaker 2 (03:48):
Oh, that is a really good one. Thank you Emily. Okay. When we're in this classroom, let's all remember to respect each other's space. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, so just imagine you have a bubble around you, and don't get close to anyone else's bubble either, especially if they don't want you to.

Speaker 1 (04:06):
Did you do the book report? Um, is that due today? Will me a little, yeah, but I think I forgot.

Speaker 2 (04:14):
Uh, will, um, we can talk about the book report later. It's okay if you haven't finished it. Let's finish.

Speaker 1 (04:22):
Okay. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (04:24):
Oh, that's okay. Um, are there any last classroom norms anyone wants to add?

Speaker 1 (04:35):
This is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (04:41):
Um, we're doing this so we can all feel, um, safe and happy in the classroom and so we can all learn. Um,

Speaker 1 (04:51):
Okay,

Speaker 2 (04:51):
We're almost done. Just wanna make sure we have everything, all of our norms on the list. Um, does anyone want to go over what we decided so far? Does anyone remember all of the norms?

Speaker 1 (05:05):
Uh, some of 'em maybe.

Speaker 2 (05:08):
Oh, do you wanna talk up?

Speaker 1 (05:10):
Okay. End simulation. Thank you.
