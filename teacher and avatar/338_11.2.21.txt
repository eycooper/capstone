Okay. Yes. Yes. So no side conversations being focused on our work. Carlos is doing a really good job. He's being a, um, great example for how to be respectful in the classroom. He's being very attentive, um, to what I'm saying and to what you guys are saying. So thank you Carlos. You're being, Hey,

Speaker 1 (02:45):

Speaker 1 (03:00):
Uh hmm. Oh, oh, you know, I was gonna say, I finally got to see the first Ironman movie, uh, over the weekend. It was really cool. Um, so just wanted to put that out there. I don't know if that's a rule, but, um, it should be a rule that everyone should see it.

Speaker 2 (03:17):
Okay. That's cool. Did you learn anything from the movie that could help us in class? Maybe

Speaker 1 (03:21):
Any? Um, well, yeah, I don't, I don't know <laugh>, I don't know if Iron Ironman has much, uh, you know, transferable skills, uh, for, for the classroom, but, um, okay. Yeah.

Speaker 1 (04:33):
Is boring. Why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (04:37):
Yeah. Okay. So it's just really important that when we come back from a break, that we just kind of remind ourselves how we are supposed to act in the classroom. Uhhuh, <affirmative>. So I know it's probably not like the exciting activity, but it is super important. Makes sense. It'll make, it'll make our activities more fun later down the road because everybody will be able to function properly. Does that make sense?

Speaker 1 (04:56):
Cool. Oh no, that totally makes sense. I was just checking.

Speaker 2 (04:59):
Oh, thank you.

Speaker 1 (05:00):
Awesome.

Speaker 2 (05:01):
That's important that we talk about how we feel. So thanks for sharing Jayla.
