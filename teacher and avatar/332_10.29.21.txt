Speaker 2 (00:56):
Sorry. Ah, it's okay. Well, since we're all back, let's review our classroom norms again. Just to get back into the swing of things. Does anyone remember our classroom norms? We had our two,

Speaker 3 (01:09):
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm getting a phone call, um, from my mom. Oh no. I think I might have forgot something at home. I'm sorry. Oh,

Speaker 2 (01:20):
It's okay.

Speaker 3 (01:22):
Okay. Uh,

Speaker 2 (01:23):
Yeah, let's remember. We can use our phone after school ends, but, okay. Sorry. I'll go over our rules again. So our, our first two were be respectful, be kind, and then always try your best. You guys remember? So what does respectful look like? What did we talk about before?

Speaker 3 (02:01):
Sorry. I'm sorry. I just said <laugh>. Oh. Stayed up too late last night. Sorry. Sorry about that. Fell

Speaker 2 (02:10):
Asleep. Okay. Well it's okay.

Speaker 3 (02:14):
Jayla, are you having your birthday party today? Yeah, I trying to be, uh, yeah, it should be fine. 30. 30.

Speaker 2 (02:28):
So part of respect is we wanna listen to the person talking, so we'll just keep that in mind going for today. Okay.

Speaker 3 (02:39):
Okay. Sorry. Yep. No problem. It's okay. Yeah.

Speaker 2 (02:46):
And then the last one was always try your best. So that's in any type of social situation. And anytime we're doing our work, even when it gets hard sometimes we'll just keep on trying. Okay. And we can encourage each other.

Speaker 3 (03:00):
I like that a lot. That's great. Um, oh, oh, uh, I just wanna mention, um, you know, I, I saw Ironman, uh, over the weekend for the first time. You know, I really haven't watched many of the Marvel movies, but, but I'll tell you, I am hooked. I'm hooked. Yeah. I don't know if you seen it the weekend watch. I dunno how many you've seen. I've only seen the first one, but, uh, but boy, uh, I'm gonna be busy this weekend watching all the other ones cause there's like a million of 'em. So anyway, I digress. <laugh>.

Speaker 2 (03:32):
Yeah, that's fun. It's okay. We can talk about our weekends, but when we start school we'll just focus on finishing our work.

Speaker 3 (03:41):
Hmm. John? Oh, um,

Speaker 2 (03:46):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. What's up, Emily?

Speaker 3 (03:48):
Yeah, I have a, I have an idea, like there would be a good, you know, um, rule for the class. Um, you know, like, uh, if, if you were like, respectful of people's space, you know, and like, not running or touching people's things, like just being respectful of other people's space, you know?

Speaker 2 (04:06):
Yeah. That's good. Yeah. So that goes along with the role of being respectful.

Speaker 3 (04:12):
Oh. Oh, Mina. Is there a book report due today? Well, it's like Thursday after vacation. Nothing is due. Yeah. But I, I, I dunno, I just wanna make sure. And I always like, uh, <laugh> always forget things, you know, <laugh>. Sorry. Sorry. It's okay. Forgive you.

Speaker 2 (04:31):
Let's come back to our discussion. Does anyone else have any other rules we wanna implement?

Speaker 3 (04:38):
This is, um, this is kinda, uh, boring. Why are, why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (04:45):
Well, if we have firm classroom rules in the beginning, then it can set us up for success whenever we do anything later. So I just wanted to go over our rules for today.

Speaker 3 (04:57):
Okay. That makes sense. That makes sense. I was just checking.

Speaker 2 (05:01):
