Speaker 1 (00:58):
I'm sitting up. You need to pay attention. I am paying attention. Stop.

Speaker 2 (01:06):
Stop the side conversation. We're gonna be talking about our <inaudible>. So one of the things we wanna have listening ears, we wanna be paying attention to the person who's talking. So I like how you listened to what I said and turned back to the conversation. Thank you for doing that.

Speaker 3 (01:42):
Carlos said

Speaker 1 (01:46):
I stayed up too late last night.

Speaker 2 (01:48):
You did? Yeah. Well, one of the things we can also do is to not have side conversations. And if you need to take a break, we can have a space in our room where you can go. And if you need to close your eyes for a second, do you think that would be helpful too? That's one of a good,

Speaker 1 (02:05):
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm awake. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:07):
Okay. <laugh>, what else do we have? We have Be respectful. What does that mean? What does that look like?

Speaker 1 (02:40):
Yeah, I got one. Um, like, um, everybody needs to focus.

Speaker 2 (02:47):
Everybody needs to focus. That's a good one. Yeah. To focus on your work. Like if we're doing an assignment or for reading. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. That's a good one. I like.

Speaker 2 (02:57):

Speaker 2 (03:28):
Thank you. So there's something else I said. Let's see. Raise our hands. Be respectful. Listening ears. Yes. Emily, you have one.

Speaker 1 (03:40):
Everybody should respect space. Like, no running around or catching other people's things.

Speaker 2 (03:49):
Yeah, that's a good one. Keeping each other's space. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And if you want to play with someone or you want to do something with someone, you can always ask and you ask respectfully. That way, you know, if someone really wants to play with you or do something with you, that's part of being respectful. Will, do you have any

Speaker 1 (04:20):
Um,

Speaker 2 (04:24):
I'll give you a hint. One is if something goes bad, what can you do? You can talk about things with people, right? If your feelings are hurt,

Speaker 1 (04:35):
Or, oh, this is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (04:40):
I know Jayla, but we have to go over our rules and our norms. If you need a second, remember we can go to our space in the classroom where you can have a second to yourself. That's one of our, oh,
