Speaker 1 (00:03):
Begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:08):
Hey. Hello, my name is Mr. Swing.

Speaker 1 (00:11):
Hi

Speaker 2 (00:11):
There. How are you?

Speaker 3 (00:13):
Good. Good,

Speaker 2 (00:14):
Good. How are you doing? Good, thank you. Uh, so today we're gonna go over some classroom norms that are gonna help you, uh, stay focused this year and learn to the best of your abilities. Uh, can anyone volunteer something that, uh, might help you? Uh, stay focused this year? Yes,

Speaker 3 (00:35):
Always, uh, paying attention.

Speaker 2 (00:37):
Always paying attention. Okay. So if I'm talking, uh, what is that? How can you model that? You're paying attention to me. How can you show me that you're paying attention?

Speaker 1 (00:46):
Well, there's better ways to pay attention. So I think that like, maybe your answer should have been something else. Um, well, let's, let's pay attention.

Speaker 2 (00:56):
Okay. But first I think a good norm in this case would be listening to each other's opinions and respecting each other's opinions. Right. And then offering your own, what, what would your advice be as far as the norm?

Speaker 1 (01:07):
Um, I would say like, showing up on time.

Speaker 2 (01:10):
Showing up. Oh, that's good. So punctuality. Excellent. So we have punctuality, we have listening. Oh, yes. Sorry, go ahead. Sorry, go ahead, Emily.

Speaker 1 (01:20):
No, I just got a, I got a text.

Speaker 2 (01:23):
Ah, okay. So I think another norm might be to keep technology at our side, so not use technology when we don't need it. Right. Gotcha. Okay. So cell phones can be great for using, for doing research in class, but they can be really distracting at times as well. Yeah,

Speaker 3 (01:39):
Yeah. Oh, what about, um, I don't know, uh, like extracurricular stuff, like, uh, um, so I'm like really into science. Okay. So like, if I like, wanted to have, like, if we do like a, we like breakout time where we like talk about, um, maybe like what we're interested in, like how, like chemistry specifically.

Speaker 2 (01:59):
Okay. Well, I can make sure that when we have our lessons, that we have time to talk amongst each other, but I think what you're talking about more is more of an interest, not really a norm. Alright. So, uh, what about, um, uh, yes. What?

Speaker 1 (02:15):
Oh, no, I was just, will was yelling at

Speaker 3 (02:18):
Me. I wasn't yelling at you.

Speaker 2 (02:20):
It was just the scene. You should, so I think another norm would be to keep our conversations to a minimum, right. When I'm speaking. So your eyes should be up here, your eyes should be up here, right? Yes. Okay. So we have technology, we have listening to each other. What about, uh, respecting each other, respecting each other's opinions? I like that. Yeah. What would that include? How would you show that you're respecting someone's opinion?

Speaker 1 (02:44):
Yeah, I think, uh, hearing them out, even if you don't like,

Speaker 3 (02:48):
Totally agree.

Speaker 2 (02:49):
Yeah, exactly. You

Speaker 3 (02:51):
Know, listen and

Speaker 2 (02:52):
Right. So you really consciously listen to what they're saying. Right. You don't jump right away and say what you think. Right.

Speaker 3 (02:59):
Okay. Yeah. No,

Speaker 2 (03:00):
Totally. Excellent. Good job.

Speaker 3 (03:02):
Hundred percent.

Speaker 2 (03:03):
Okay.

Speaker 3 (03:03):
Oh, we're having a, a science fair is gonna be happening I think like around Halloween,

Speaker 2 (03:10):
So, okay. Yeah. I don't know. Oh, excellent. Thank you for letting us know that that's not exactly what we're talking about right now. We're talking about our norms that we're coming up with together. Gotcha. Yeah. So let's stick to that topic. Okay. Okay. So that could be another norm. So let's stay on task with what we're focusing on, on at the moment. So if we're doing math, we're doing math, we're not talking about music or whatever, right? Yes.

Speaker 3 (03:34):
I just think, uh, another thing that would help us, like pay attention is it, if no one said this already mm-hmm. <affirmative>, like no cell phones and, and, and

Speaker 2 (03:44):
Like Right. We mentioned

Speaker 3 (03:45):
Social media.

Speaker 2 (03:46):
Social media. Okay. So that's more specific than what we mentioned. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So just using our cell phones for academic

Speaker 3 (03:53):
Purposes. Is this boring? Why are we doing it? I don't know why we're doing

Speaker 2 (03:56):
Well, it may seem boring now, but it'll help you later in the year, trust me, because it'll, it'll make sure that we're all learning together. We're not distracted yet. Excellent.

Speaker 3 (04:08):
I

Speaker 2 (04:08):
Hear that. All right. Anyone else have any other things to offer? Um, what about raising your hand? What about raising your hand? Oh, yeah. Actually,

Speaker 3 (04:20):
Like, always make a good effort. Is that too generic?

Speaker 2 (04:23):
Yeah. No, that's good. I think that's something to keep in mind. It's generic. Think of a better, wait a second. Wait a second. Remember we said that our remember our norm about listening to each other? Exactly. What? And not jumping right on what people say. I'm sorry. All right. Let's respect each other's opinions. Sorry. Thank you. Sorry. Okay.

Speaker 3 (04:40):
Sorry Mr.

Speaker 2 (04:40):
Sw. That's all right. Alright. All right. So all those norms, I'm gonna adhere to them too because that's important, right? That I also follow these norms. Yep. Right. All right. Excellent. Well, thank you for talking to me about this. I'm glad that we, uh, had this discussion. I think it'll be a productive year.

Speaker 3 (04:56):
Cool. No problem. Bye.
