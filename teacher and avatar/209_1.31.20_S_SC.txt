Speaker 1 (00:02):
And start simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:09):
Hi guys. Can you hear me? Everything good? Awesome. Okay, so we're going to establish our classroom norms today.

Speaker 1 (00:18):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (00:20):
First, are there any suggestions that you all can think of that you would like to talk about for having as our classroom norms?

Speaker 1 (00:30):
Uh, let's see. Well answer. I don't have an answer.

Speaker 2 (00:42):
Okay. I can answer, I can give y'all some ideas that I have come up with and see how you think with it.

Speaker 1 (00:48):
Sound good? So, well I just, I don't have anything to say. Mina.

Speaker 2 (00:52):
Okay. Mina. I, me, I'm over here also. Okay. Thank you. So we can actually, a first norm that I was thinking of is when the teacher is talking, that you could technically look towards me. So I know that you're listening and then we can engage with each other.

Speaker 1 (01:10):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (01:10):
How does that sound?

Speaker 1 (01:12):
Sounds good. Awesome.

Speaker 2 (01:14):
Yep.

Speaker 1 (01:14):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (01:16):
So another one next, another one I was thinking of is when we want to speak we can raise our hands.

Speaker 1 (01:25):
Okay. Sounds good.

Speaker 2 (01:26):
Awesome. Third? Yes. Jayla?

Speaker 1 (01:31):
I was thinking maybe like, no texting in

Speaker 2 (01:34):
Class. Okay. That I agree with that one. I forget cell phones exist sometimes, um, for younger kids now. Oh. So,

Speaker 1 (01:44):
Oh, whoa. I wanted to say, um, how do you feel about like, um, chemistry and like science and stuff? Hey

Speaker 2 (01:51):
Carlos. Oh

Speaker 1 (01:53):
Yes.

Speaker 2 (01:55):
Um, how about we put that conversation off to a little bit later?

Speaker 1 (02:00):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (02:01):
And we can get through the classroom door. So I definitely wanna hear how chemistry sounds. All right. So, but did anybody else have any suggestions?

Speaker 1 (02:09):
Why don't you talk, uh, you be quiet. Stop. Tell me what to do.

Speaker 2 (02:16):
Okay, so 1, 2, 3 eyes on me.

Speaker 1 (02:21):
Okay. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:22):
Sounds great. Okay, so we have what two have we, can someone tell me the two we thought of right now?

Speaker 1 (02:32):
I'm sorry, I didn't, what was that last?

Speaker 2 (02:35):
What norms have we decided so far? We have no texting in class. Yep. What's another one?

Speaker 1 (02:42):
Um, be respectful of like other people's opinions. Myself.

Speaker 2 (02:47):
Okay. Good one. That's a good one. I like that one. Cool.

Speaker 1 (02:50):
Um, thank

Speaker 2 (02:51):
You. And how can we show our respect to others? How, what are some things we can do so that people know that we're respecting their opinions?

Speaker 1 (02:59):
Um, like, you know, respecting their opinion. Like if you don't agree with them, you know, hear 'em out and if you disagree, talk about it like civilly, you know, oh, are we gonna have a science fair this year? That's what I meant to ask before.

Speaker 2 (03:15):
Um, sh I actually don't know. I soon will be later in the semester.

Speaker 1 (03:21):
I have ideas. I'm just saying.

Speaker 2 (03:23):
Awesome. Do you have any class norm ideas?

Speaker 1 (03:26):
What's that?

Speaker 2 (03:27):
Do you have any ideas for the class norms?

Speaker 1 (03:29):
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, show up on time.

Speaker 2 (03:32):
That's a good one. I like that one. Um, cause that shows we have respect for each other and the class and make sure everything, yeah. Going smoothly. Um, what I thought of is to use kind words when we're speaking to our friends and our classmates because that's another way to show respect and we can act kindly towards them.

Speaker 1 (03:52):
This is boring. Why are we doing this? I'm sorry, I forgot

Speaker 2 (03:55):
We are doing this So we can have a productive school year and we can go on and have this set up now so we don't have to deal with it later.

Speaker 1 (04:02):
Fair enough. Fair enough. Okay. Gotcha.

Speaker 2 (04:06):
Okay.

Speaker 1 (04:07):
Makes sense.

Speaker 2 (04:08):
So last four I believe. Are there any more you can think of?

Speaker 1 (04:18):
Always be like, ready to work. That'd be good.

Speaker 2 (04:21):
Okay. And how can we, how what does that look like?

Speaker 1 (04:24):
What does it look like? Mina. Lemme tell her I'm trying to talk to her. Sarah mean like maybe Will has to learn how to be quiet cause he doesn't know. How does his mom teach him? Okay.

Speaker 2 (04:41):
Okay. Um, enough that's stop doesn't really follow her kind words Norm. Um, so how can we reword that?

Speaker 1 (04:52):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (04:53):
To be not aggressive.

Speaker 1 (04:56):
Sorry. Um, so anyway, sorry I lost track.

Speaker 2 (05:02):
Um, it's okay. And

Speaker 1 (05:03):
Then I have a contentious relationship. I think it's alright. Cool.

Speaker 2 (05:10):
Glad you're aware

Speaker 1 (05:10):
Of it. And end simulation. Okay.
