Speaker 1 (00:00):
Hello, begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:04):
Hi everyone. How is everyone today? Hey,

Speaker 1 (00:06):
Nick. Good, how are you?

Speaker 2 (00:09):
I'm so good. I missed you guys so much when we were on vacation, but I'm so glad that you're back in the classroom now, and I know we've been gone for a while, so I think that it would benefit everyone, myself included, if we go over our classroom rules. So remember we have four of them, so I'll just go ahead and list them for you guys first. Okay. So the first one was to listen to others when they speak with our eyes and our bodies. So who could

Speaker 1 (00:35):
Tell me, sit, listen,

Speaker 2 (00:37):
Mina, this is a great example. So could you tell me a great way to show others that you're listening?

Speaker 1 (00:44):
Oh, um, just like face friend and pay attention. That's what I was telling.

Speaker 2 (00:49):
Yeah. Yeah, to pay attention. So we can do that with our eyes and our bodies. So with our eyes we can make eye contact. That's one way to show attention and another is to have your body facing forward. Great. So let's look at our second one. Our second one was to raise your hand if you have a question. Oh, dear. Or you're answering a question. So, Emily, if you have a question, what should you do if you have a question that you want to ask the teacher?

Speaker 1 (01:14):
Oh, I'm sorry, mom just started texting me, so I'm just telling her to, because you say left something at home.

Speaker 2 (01:25):
Yeah. Well, we're all getting back used to being at school, so let's remember not to use our phones right now. Okay.

Speaker 1 (01:30):
Okay. Her up.

Speaker 2 (01:32):
You can wait until the end of the day. She'll understand, I promise. Okay.

Speaker 1 (01:35):
So

Speaker 2 (01:35):
We can raise our hand if we have a question or we want to answer. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> question. So should we shout out if we have a question that counts, right?

Speaker 1 (01:47):
Um, definitely, definitely not,

Speaker 2 (01:49):
Definitely not. That's not the same time thing as raising our hands for a question. So let's go back to our first one. Remember, we want to make sure that we're maintaining eye contact and having our bodies sitting up so others are paying attention, right? Will.

Speaker 1 (02:05):
Yeah. Oh yeah. I I, I I was really tired. I'm sorry I fell asleep, but I'm awake now.

Speaker 2 (02:10):
I'm awake. I know we're all getting used to being back in school, but let's try to do our best with these rules now that we're back. All right. All right. Now let's talk about our third one. So if you have something off topic to say, so it's not something we're talking about in school, maybe it's something about your vacation, we can save that for after school or for recess. Cool. Okay, because I have stuff I'd love to tell you about my vacation too, but I'll wait till recess. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> and we can all talk about it today, right? Yeah. Jayla.

Speaker 1 (02:36):
Yeah, I was just thinking like another good one would be like, you know, just showing up on time and like, I was being like, ready to work on whatever you're working on.

Speaker 2 (02:45):
Yeah. Jayla, I think that's an awesome example. Thank you for sharing that. That's a great rule.

Speaker 1 (02:50):
No

Speaker 2 (02:50):
Problem. It's especially good to remember now that we're back from vacation because showing up on time can be hard. Like Will was saying he was sleepy, so we might wanna sleep in, but showing up on time, why, why is it important to show up on time? Emily, do you have any thoughts? Oh,

Speaker 1 (03:06):
Oh, you know, I was gonna say everybody, I finally got to see the first Ironman movie. Carlos,

Speaker 2 (03:11):
If you have a thought, could you either raise your hand if it has to with the discussion or save it for recess?

Speaker 1 (03:16):
Okay, I'll save it. I'll save it. No problem. Thank you.

Speaker 2 (03:19):
No problem. Great. So back to where, what I was saying. So Emily, why do you think it's important to, um, show up on time to school?

Speaker 1 (03:27):
Oh, because, and like, you know, everyone will be on like the same page. Yeah. And, you know, we'll be able to have like discussions and stuff like that, you know? I agree. All kinda, yeah. Know we want, we want working together. Yeah. Yeah. I was gonna also say, um, while I'm talking, uh, another good one would be being like, uh, respectful of people's space and not like, you know, phone or you're getting, you know, getting in people's space.

Speaker 2 (04:03):
So, yeah. Yeah, I agree. Emily. So, Mina, do you have an example? What might Emily mean? Why? What's an example of not staying in our own space?

Speaker 1 (04:11):
Oh, Mina. Did, did we have a anything due today in work? No.

Speaker 2 (04:17):
Well, if you have a question, remember you can raise your hand, but if it doesn't have to do with class Okay, then let's save it for later.

Speaker 1 (04:23):
Okay. Well, I thought we added homework, but I guess we don't. We

Speaker 2 (04:26):
Probably don't. All right. We can save that for later. Okay. Right now we'll just go over <inaudible> rules. So Mina, do you have any thoughts on that?

Speaker 1 (04:34):
This is boring. Why? Why are we doing the cn?

Speaker 2 (04:38):
I don't. Why, why do you think we are doing this? Jayla? Does anyone have any ideas? Why should we look over our classroom rules? We already made them, so why would we do that? Um, yeah, Mina.

Speaker 1 (04:48):
Yeah. So like we can, um, you know, all have kinda a set of, uh, standards that we would all, we all know we have to kind of meet, like pay attention and show up.

Speaker 2 (05:02):
Yeah. So we can all have the same set of standards.

Speaker 1 (05:05):
Hey,
