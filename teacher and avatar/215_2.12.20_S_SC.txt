Speaker 1 (00:05):
Begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:09):
Okay guys, we're gonna talk about some of the behavioral expectations that we have in our classroom. Do you guys know what behavioral expectations are?

Speaker 1 (00:20):
Um, so like, maybe just rules that we're all expect, expected to follow. Follow?

Speaker 2 (00:29):
Yeah. Jayla, I think, um, we can think about them as rules, but, um, I feel like maybe rules are, it's more of a strict word, um, and feels a little bit more punitive.

Speaker 1 (00:41):
It's an expectation.

Speaker 2 (00:43):
Yeah. We, we expect that you, um, come to school and behave in a certain way.

Speaker 1 (00:50):
Hey, Paul are shy. Come on dude. Nothing shy.

Speaker 2 (00:57):
Let's pay attention to what we're trying to talk about. So we're talking about what we expect from one another behavior wise at school. Um, I'm gonna go ahead and just tell you what I think is a good one. Um, and I'd love to hear your thoughts. Um,

Speaker 1 (01:12):
Sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:14):
That's okay. Let's pay attention. So, okay.

Speaker 1 (01:17):
I keep getting these so texts, sorry,

Speaker 2 (01:21):
We're gonna put phones away. So the expectation is that we come to school ready to learn. Um, so that does include, you know, being ready to be engaged. We're not gonna have any distractions. Do you guys think that that's a good behavioral expectation?

Speaker 1 (01:35):
Oh, I think it's a, it's a great expectation also. I was thinking like, if you would be cool if we could all like, um, you know, build our own like special, I was thinking like, it would be really cool if we had

Speaker 2 (01:48):
Like, Carlos, is this related to what we're talking about right now?

Speaker 1 (01:51):
Well, it would be like all of us participating in something. Um, and it would be like we all build like volcanoes and stuff.

Speaker 2 (01:58):
Okay, Carlos, that is a great idea for when we're doing a science project, but right now we're talking about expectations. So we're in school, we're ready to learn. Number two, and I think this is really important, is that we're gonna respect ourselves, others, and school property. Can you explain maybe why that would be an important expectation for us to have of ourselves? Emily, do you have any ideas? You

Speaker 1 (02:23):
Speak down.

Speaker 2 (02:25):
Hey, Mina. And will

Speaker 1 (02:26):
You speak up

Speaker 2 (02:28):
Mina?

Speaker 1 (02:28):
Yes.

Speaker 2 (02:29):
Sorry, I'm gonna need you to stop talking to Will. Okay.

Speaker 1 (02:32):
Okay, fine.

Speaker 2 (02:35):
So Emily, did you, do you understand why it's important to respect ourselves, others, and school property?

Speaker 1 (02:41):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Absolutely.

Speaker 2 (02:44):
Yeah. So that's a great expectation. Uh, I'm gonna expect it of you guys and I think you guys should expect it of each other, um, and expect it of yourselves. So we're gonna just overall be super respectful, um, because that's what makes a good classroom environment. Um, and third of all is be safe. Um, can you tell me what being safe might look like?

Speaker 1 (03:08):
Oh, the science fair's coming up. So that's Carlos.

Speaker 2 (03:12):
We're not talking about science fair right now. I'm sorry. Can you talk to me about what being safe may look like?

Speaker 1 (03:19):
Um, well, maybe like, you know, don't run, don't throw things.

Speaker 2 (03:24):
Don't run. Don't

Speaker 1 (03:26):
Throw things like a volcano. Don't, don't like,

Speaker 2 (03:29):
Um, right. We're gonna just not talk about the volcanoes right now, but I appreciate your enthusiasm. Okay? So we're gonna be safe, um, with not, you know, trying not to get hurt. Um, and we can also be maybe

Speaker 1 (03:45):
Like,

Speaker 2 (03:45):
Go

Speaker 1 (03:45):
Ahead. Not taking other people's stuff. That'd be good.

Speaker 2 (03:49):
Yeah. I think that maybe goes into respecting others and their properties. This

Speaker 1 (03:54):
Is boring. Why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (03:56):
Okay. So we don't need to be having those types of outbursts, but, um, yeah, for now, that's what I expect of you guys and I will be following up to make sure that we're all following these expectations. Um, do you guys wanna tell me what you did over the weekend?

Speaker 1 (04:14):
Hung out with my dog.

Speaker 2 (04:17):
That sounds like a lot of fun.

Speaker 1 (04:19):
Surprise. I built a volcano.

Speaker 2 (04:22):
I'm glad you did, Carlos. Nina,

Speaker 1 (04:23):
What'd you do this weekend? Um, I made a darn board with your face.

Speaker 2 (04:28):
Okay. Nina. Nina.

Speaker 1 (04:29):
Well, well

Speaker 2 (04:30):
We can't talk to our friends that way. That's not kind language. And it's not respectful either. Well,

Speaker 1 (04:37):
Well be more respectful. You'd be more respectful. You'd

Speaker 2 (04:40):
Be more respect. Nina, I'm gonna have to talk to you afterwards. And Will, I'm, we're gonna talk as well. Okay. This is not respectful of each other.

Speaker 1 (04:48):
Jayla issues. What

Speaker 2 (04:49):
Did you Sorry, will we don't speak to each other in that way. Jayla, can you tell me what you did over the weekend?

Speaker 1 (04:57):
Uh, well, uh, actually had a really nice weekend. I went to a museum, uh, saw some dinosaurs. It was pretty cool.

Speaker 2 (05:07):
Nice. So you learned a lot.

Speaker 1 (05:09):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. That's pretty

Speaker 2 (05:11):
Cool. That's great. And simulation. Uh,
