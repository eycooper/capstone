Speaker 1 (00:11):
Begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:14):
Good afternoon class. How are you today? Good.

Speaker 3 (00:18):
Good,

Speaker 2 (00:19):
Good. All right, so I thought we'd go ahead and just jump into our conversation of our classroom expectations. So this is what I expect you guys to do, the moment you walk in through the door and the moment you meet. So, let's talk about why it's important to be respectful. Who can tell me what being respectful means to them?

Speaker 3 (00:43):
Well speak up [inaudible] Stop.

Speaker 2 (00:48):
So I think

Speaker 3 (00:49):
I ask a question,

Speaker 2 (00:51):
Rena. I think a good way to start this conversation is actually talk about why we raise our hands. So does anyone know why we raise our hands in a class? Cause I know we don't raise our hands at home when we need to talk.

Speaker 3 (01:03):
Um, so we'll get order I think.

Speaker 2 (01:06):
Right? So what would happen if you guys all started shouting out at once? Would that be very productive?

Speaker 3 (01:12):
No. No. Whoa. Sorry. It's my mom. <laugh>.

Speaker 2 (01:17):
So let's put our phones away because school doesn't let us have our phones out. Your mom, sorry, who knows? You're at school so she shouldn't be texting you.

Speaker 3 (01:25):
She's, she's really too much with the tech texting. Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2 (01:31):
So let's talk about why we raise our hands. So like you said, it would be chaos if we all shouted out. Do we kind of agree with that? Even though we don't raise our hands at home in a classroom, we have to raise our

Speaker 3 (01:42):
Hands. Yeah, it would be chaotic also, I was thinking like maybe we could um, have like a, a messaging system or something like that. Um, I was also actually thinking about the science fair early on and I don't know if you had any ideas about that but over the holidays I was making, um,

Speaker 2 (02:01):
Well Carlos, we'll talk about the science fair when it gets closer, but right now we need to focus on our expectations cause we still have a lot.

Speaker 3 (02:08):
We're too far away, that's

Speaker 2 (02:10):
For sure. Yep. We'll get there. But so one of the things about being respectful is your hands

Speaker 3 (02:17):
Will, you're so passing. Oh, sorry. Will.

Speaker 2 (02:21):
And your attention on me. So one of the things we talked about is raising our hands that's respectful of each other. How can we be respectful when we're talking to each other, to me to another teacher? Jayla, do you have an idea?

Speaker 3 (02:38):
Like raise our hand and also like, um, you know, hear people out when they have something to

Speaker 2 (02:45):
Say, right? So we're listening to people. We're not interrupting. Are we gonna say judgy things? Are we gonna be mean? We're not gonna be mean, right? Yeah. We're just gonna use nice words when we talk to people. So saying please and thank you are a, a good way to do that. That's definitely respectful.

Speaker 3 (03:02):
Yeah,

Speaker 2 (03:03):
I agree with that. And then the last thing I thought of when being respectful is our classroom and its materials. So I know you guys all come prepared with your own materials every day.

Speaker 3 (03:14):
Oh, so I made a paper machine dragon um, over the weekend and I was thinking like maybe, I don't

Speaker 2 (03:20):
Know all Carlos. I would love to hear about that at recess or lunch meeting. Okay, right now we're gonna talk about what materials means in class. So I provide a lot of materials and you guys have a lot of materials. So what would happen if I just took all your pencils or something from home and just started breaking 'em? How would you feel?

Speaker 3 (03:39):
That'd be really weird. I wouldn't like

Speaker 2 (03:41):
It. It'd be weird. You wouldn't like it? Yeah. That's not very respectful of stuff. So I wouldn't expect you guys to come into my classroom and start doing that. Not just with pencils but showing on desks, anything like that. That's all a part of respecting your space. Cool. Seems like we have an understanding I wanted to talk about was there's idea this is

Speaker 3 (03:59):
Boring. Why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (04:00):
I'm sorry. Because Jayla, it's great to have a good foundation because maybe you haven't been in school very long and that's true. It's very different at home versus at school. Yeah. So we need to make sure we're all on the same page.

Speaker 3 (04:13):
I trust you.

Speaker 2 (04:14):
I trust you. Thank you. I appreciate that. So another I wanna talk about was us being safe. Cause there's a lot of kids at this school and why is it important for us to be safe in the classroom or around the school In the hallway.

Speaker 3 (04:26):
I'll tell you something about Will, let's practice Will's a

Speaker 2 (04:31):
Mina, let's practice Will all, will and Mina's a whole class conversation right now. Not a side to side. Okay,

Speaker 3 (04:38):
We have some issues. Sorry,

Speaker 2 (04:41):
I'll see if I can work out a solution with your seats. But for right now, let's talk about being safe. So why is it important for us to be safe in the hallway, for example?

Speaker 3 (04:51):
Um, well I guess I can be close, but no. Yeah, it's uh, I don't know. Being aware of people,

Speaker 2 (05:01):
Right? So when we're in the hallway there might be other classes going on. That's why I make you guys be quiet when you're in the line. Yeah, in the hallway. So that we don't interrupt other classes and we don't run, we walk, we use walking feed, right? So that no one runs into each other. Cuz sometimes those big classes, I agree. If I'm not looking where I'm going, I might run into something. So that's why it's important for us to always be looking forward and have walking.
