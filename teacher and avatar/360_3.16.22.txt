Speaker 1 (00:01):
Begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:10):
Morning, everyone.

Speaker 1 (00:14):
Good morning.

Speaker 2 (00:18):
How's everyone doing today after we got back today?

Speaker 1 (00:22):
Great. How was your vacation?

Speaker 2 (00:25):
It was good. I really enjoyed myself. I got to hang out with friends. It was very fun.

Speaker 1 (00:30):
Cool. Me too. Me too.

Speaker 2 (00:34):
I love it. I love to hear it. But since we've been out of the classroom for so long, I figured it might be good to refresh ourselves on what it's like being in our classroom.

Speaker 1 (00:44):
Well sit up.

Speaker 2 (00:47):
He's fine. Don't worry about it.

Speaker 1 (00:49):
Yeah, I am fine sitting up. Go

Speaker 2 (00:52):
<laugh>. But I would like to go over really quick some of our classroom norms. So remember when we ask questions, it's always very important that we don't talk over each other, that we raise our hands so I can get to all of you one at a time. Remember?

Speaker 1 (01:12):
Oh,

Speaker 2 (01:15):
Hmm. Everything okay?

Speaker 1 (01:16):
Oh, yeah. My, my mom's sending me a text.

Speaker 2 (01:21):
All right. That's okay for today because it's been a while and I'm sure it's important. But remember, we also Yeah. Have a policy of phones in the classroom.

Speaker 1 (01:31):
Oh, right, right. Sorry. I just wonder if I forgot something. Hmm,

Speaker 2 (01:36):
You're fine. If it seems urgent, feel free to go check it. We're just going over some stuff right now. Remember also that when we are talking, when one of one of us is talking, that means me or one of you that the rest of us are silent and attentive. Right? It's very important that we show respect to other people while they're talking.

Speaker 1 (02:08):
Oh, come my birthday party. Yeah, of course. It's tomorrow. Tomorrow after school.

Speaker 2 (02:19):
Remember what I just said while I'm talking? You guys need to be attentive. Now, I'm sure the birthday party is fun on topic of conversation, but when can you talk about it later? Right?

Speaker 1 (02:34):
Awesome. Got it.

Speaker 2 (02:37):
Will, are you asleep?

Speaker 1 (02:40):
What? No.

Speaker 2 (02:42):
No. Kind looks like you are, bud.

Speaker 1 (02:46):
Sorry. I, oh, I guess I just didn't get much sleep last night.

Speaker 2 (02:51):
It's fine. It's nothing I haven't seen before. It's early in the morning, but remember, try and be awake and aware when I'm talking, Jayla. Yes.

Speaker 1 (03:01):
Yeah. I wondered if I could suggest, um, a norm.

Speaker 2 (03:06):
Of course. Always

Speaker 1 (03:10):
No cell phones.

Speaker 2 (03:13):
I would agree with that. Yes. I think that's something we could absolutely make a norm. Yes.

Speaker 1 (03:27):
Oh, crap. Wait. I was gonna tell you guys, I saw Ironman over break. It was amazing. I've never seen it before. My dad didn't let me. It was well worth the wait. Holy crowd.

Speaker 2 (03:42):
You wanna tell us a little bit about that, Carlos, before is yours and we'll all,

Speaker 1 (03:46):
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, actually,

Speaker 2 (03:51):
Yes. Emily?

Speaker 1 (03:54):
Uh, yes. I thought that, uh, I could suggest it a norm too.

Speaker 2 (04:01):
Well, let's wait one second while Carlos tells us about his experience over break, and then you can suggest our norm. Okay.

Speaker 1 (04:08):
Well, I just wanna be respectful of other people's space.

Speaker 2 (04:14):
I agree with that, and we'll talk more about it in a second. Carlos,

Speaker 1 (04:21):
What, what was the question?

Speaker 2 (04:23):
Tell us about what happened over break.

Speaker 1 (04:26):
What, well, what stop poking me. I'm, I'm just worried. Do we have a book report due today? I don't know. Check your planner. How do you not know? You know everything.

Speaker 2 (04:39):
Well, you know, we have

Speaker 1 (04:40):
One of these days proud

Speaker 2 (04:41):
To talk and No, for the record, definitely don't have a book report due today.

Speaker 1 (04:50):
Oh, thank goodness. <laugh>,

Speaker 2 (04:54):
This

Speaker 1 (04:54):
Is boring. Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (05:00):
Because, well, it may seem boring. It never feels good when someone talks over you. Right? Never feels good to be disrespected in the, the classroom. Yeah. Think about for a second. Okay. How you might feel if I spent, oh, it's over.

Speaker 3 (05:18):
End simulation.
