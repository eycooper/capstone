Speaker 1 (00:00):
It's time for your session to start, begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:06):
Hi teacher.

Speaker 3 (00:07):
Hi everyone. How are you?

Speaker 2 (00:11):
Good, good.

Speaker 3 (00:14):
Awesome. So today we're, I hope you had a nice vacation. As we come back together as a group, I just wanna go over some norms and expectations we have in our classroom community. How does that sound to you?

Speaker 2 (00:30):
Uh, that sounds good. I think we should have one, um, of no cell phones.

Speaker 3 (00:35):
Oh, okay. What are you thinking, Carlos?

Speaker 2 (00:39):
No cell phones.

Speaker 3 (00:41):
No cell phones. Okay. So keeping our cell phones away for the day when we're in our classroom.

Speaker 2 (00:48):
No. Will sit up. I'm sitting up. Mina. No, you weren't,

Speaker 3 (00:52):
Weren't listening. Nina and Will Here. Eyes up here friends.

Speaker 2 (00:56):
Hi Nina.

Speaker 3 (00:58):
We're gonna do a couple together. That's okay. We're gonna do a couple together as a group and I think Carlos has us off to a great start. So as, as a reminder, if you have something to share, please raise your hand. Hi mom. Send

Speaker 2 (01:15):
A text. I wonder what I forgot at home.

Speaker 3 (01:19):
Oh, that's okay. Emily. We can check that with you and maybe we can even check that together. But right now

Speaker 2 (01:25):
Texting me,

Speaker 3 (01:30):
I wonder too, but let's, let's keep your phone away for now. As Carlos reminded us, that's one of our rules as a class. We're gonna keep our phones away for the day. I'm tired.

Speaker 2 (01:44):
I'm so tired. We stayed up too late last night.

Speaker 3 (01:48):
Oh, are you tired? Will,

Speaker 2 (01:52):
Yeah.

Speaker 3 (01:56):
Okay. Well one thing that I want us to remember, and it's really the main thing is to respect each other and respect ourselves. Does anyone have an example of what that might look like in our classroom?

Speaker 2 (02:12):
Hey Emily, are you coming to jump today? Um, I dunno. Jayla, maybe if my mom lets me. Well, a lot of kids are gonna be there after school, so if you wanna meet the flag. Maybe my mom ride. Okay.

Speaker 3 (02:28):
Yeah,

Speaker 2 (02:28):
I'd like to go.

Speaker 3 (02:30):
Can I have your attention up here please?

Speaker 2 (02:33):
Yes.

Speaker 3 (02:34):
Awesome. So would either of you like to share a way that we can respect each other and ourselves in our classroom community? Yeah. Jayla, thanks for raising your hand. Um,

Speaker 2 (02:49):
Yeah, just, um, like to, uh, everybody needs to focus.

Speaker 3 (02:55):
Oh, okay. So what does that look like? Could you give us an example?

Speaker 2 (03:00):
Yeah, just like, um, listen to you and raise your hand before you talk. Like no side conversations.

Speaker 3 (03:07):
Oh, okay. So this idea of side conversations. What do you think we should do if we have a really important thought and we wanna share it with our neighbor? Oh,

Speaker 2 (03:17):
I have one. I just saw the Ironman movies this summer and I loved them. They were so good. Can I tell you all about those? Has anyone seen them? I love Marvel movie movies.

Speaker 3 (03:28):
Hmm. That is, that is an awesome question. I wonder if we could practice together what we would do if we wanted to share that idea. But we're supposed to be listening to the teacher or listening to one of our classmates. Oh, right. What do you think is a good idea to do? If you have that idea in your mind and you say, oh, I wanna tell my, I wanna tell my neighbor this, but you realize that we're supposed to be paying attention upfront. What do you think you should do instead?

Speaker 2 (03:57):
Um, well raise your hand.

Speaker 3 (04:02):
Okay. So raise your hand and would you wanna share with the whole class?

Speaker 2 (04:09):
Um, maybe. Yeah,

Speaker 3 (04:11):
Maybe. Okay. So that's one idea. We can raise our hand. Emily, is that a hand?

Speaker 2 (04:17):
I was just saying we should, um, classroom norm at being respectful of other people's face, like not touching other people's things.

Speaker 3 (04:26):
Oh, good one. So part of being respectful at each other

Speaker 2 (04:33):
Book? No, I dunno. Well, I thought we had a book report now we have to do. Okay.

Speaker 3 (04:45):
Hey, well, we'll talk about the before soon, okay. Remember no side conversations. I know it's hard.

Speaker 2 (04:53):
Yeah, this is boring. Why are we doing this again, teacher?

Speaker 3 (04:58):
Well, we have to come together as a group and talk about our norms before we can begin our lesson. Are you all excited to

Speaker 2 (05:06):
<laugh> End simulation?
