Speaker 1 (00:00):
For your session to start. Uh, so begin simulation. Hello.

Speaker 2 (00:12):

Speaker 1 (00:14):
Okay. Hi there. Hi. Hey there. How are you?

Speaker 2 (00:18):
I'm well. How are you all

Speaker 1 (00:19):
Doing All right. How was your break?

Speaker 2 (00:22):
It was great. How was you guys' day when I wasn't here?

Speaker 1 (00:26):
It was okay. We had a good time. I watched a lot of movies, that's for sure.

Speaker 2 (00:31):
Nice. What did you watch?

Speaker 1 (00:34):
Um, oh wow. I should get a list.

Speaker 2 (00:37):
<laugh>.

Speaker 1 (00:38):
Oh, well I'm sitting here. What are you talking about? You should sit up Peter. Paying attention. I, I'm, what do you mean? Wait.

Speaker 2 (00:51):
So we're going to review the expectations of the classroom, especially during transitions. So who, who can tell me what we do in the classroom? Who can tell me one expectation?

Speaker 1 (01:04):
Um, let, oh, sorry. I'm getting a text from my mom. Oh, no. If again, that's something at home. Oh, no. Oh, no. Um, you know, we should, if we're transitioning, I think, uh, you know, uh, taking, um, being quiet and being respectful with each other, does that happens is a good idea.

Speaker 2 (01:31):
What would respect for being quiet? What would that look like and sound like?

Speaker 1 (01:38):
Um, I guess like not having straight conversations and stuff and just sort of getting from one place to the other without too much of a, a fuss.

Speaker 2 (01:46):
Okay. Yeah.

Speaker 1 (01:48):
Hmm.

Speaker 2 (01:50):
Um, will, what do you think another expectation is?

Speaker 1 (01:53):
Oh, oh, dear. I, you know what? I, I stayed up with you late last night. I'm sorry, I'm awake now. Um, what was the question?

Speaker 2 (02:01):
What do you think another expectation is? Jayla told us one. What do you think?

Speaker 1 (02:06):
Are you gonna come today? Birthday party lady? The end trampoline. Oh, oh, jump. Oh, cool.

Speaker 2 (02:17):
Let's give our friend will a turn.

Speaker 1 (02:19):
Yeah. Um, so well talk. Oh, um, okay. Uh, yeah, I think, I think, uh, being like respectful means like paying attention and like, uh, maybe keeping your hands to yourself and like doing your work when you're supposed to. Yeah.

Speaker 2 (02:36):
Yeah. That's awesome. Thanks for sharing.

Speaker 1 (02:39):
Sure, sure.

Speaker 2 (02:42):
Does anyone have anything else?

Speaker 1 (02:44):
Yeah, I think I've another one.

Speaker 2 (02:46):
Oh, thanks for raising your hand, Jayla.

Speaker 1 (02:48):
Sure. Um, so I was thinking like, you know, it's always good to show up on time and, uh, you know, always be ready to work, you know, on, on whatever we are supposed to be talking about or, or do our reading or, or discussion or whatever. So we should just be like, kind of ready to go,

Speaker 2 (03:04):
Right? Yeah, very true.

Speaker 1 (03:10):
Oh, oh, you know what I was just gonna say about movies, I, you know, I finally saw the first Ironman and let me tell you what, a movie, uh, that Robert Downey Jr. Is, uh, is a talent, that's for sure. So, I dunno if you've seen it. I'm not a big fan of superheroes myself, but, wow. Good stuff, stuff.

Speaker 2 (03:34):
And Nina, do you have another expectation that we should follow?

Speaker 1 (03:40):
Um, maybe like, uh, you know, um, not eating in class maybe.

Speaker 2 (03:49):
Yeah.

Speaker 1 (03:49):
I

Speaker 2 (03:50):
Have fun. Oh, Emily. Yeah.

Speaker 1 (03:53):
Yeah. So I think to maybe be respectful of other people's space and not to like, pick things that aren't yours and things like that.

Speaker 2 (04:05):
Yeah. Something

Speaker 1 (04:10):
Like an assignment today or anything. We didn't have like a, like any homework did we?

Speaker 2 (04:16):
No. Have any homework? No, I don't think we had any homework.

Speaker 1 (04:19):
I didn't think so. I I just, that nap kind of threw me off. I'm sorry. Um, yeah. Okay. Cool, cool, cool. I'm sorry.

Speaker 2 (04:28):
So what are you, what are we doing today?

Speaker 1 (04:32):
Oh, I don't know. I'd love to talk about Ironman, that's for sure. This is kind of boring. Why are we doing this? What are we doing?

Speaker 2 (04:41):
Well, we had to review the expectations because I was on vacation and I didn't want you guys to forget.

Speaker 1 (04:47):
Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, makes sense.

Speaker 2 (04:50):
An awesome job with remembering.

Speaker 1 (04:53):
Okay. Right now I already thought of like two norms, so pick up some Slack guys. Come, geez. All right. And.
