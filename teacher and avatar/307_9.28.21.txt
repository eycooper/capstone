Speaker 1 (00:00):
Okay. Um, it is time for your session to start. So begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:08):
Hi class. Welcome back to school. We're gonna start today's class by reviewing some of our classroom norms after your break. So, can anyone tell me a norm that we've talked about that we've established this year?

Speaker 3 (00:24):
Ah, anyone no cell phones or texting rather in class?

Speaker 2 (00:31):
Alright Carlos, thank you for that. So, one norm that we have is that we don't use our cell phones in class. And why don't we use our cell phones in class?

Speaker 3 (00:39):
Um, oh, sit up. I'm sitting up.

Speaker 2 (00:46):
Nina voices off.

Speaker 3 (00:48):
Okay, sorry.

Speaker 2 (00:50):
Why don't we use, Carlos? Had a great point. Why don't we use our cell phones in class?

Speaker 3 (00:58):
Um, it's really disruptive, I think.

Speaker 2 (01:01):
Yeah. Great. Jayla. Yeah, it is really disruptive because if we're focusing on something else and we can't be focusing on what's going on, um, in class and we can't learn. Does anyone else have any other

Speaker 3 (01:12):
Oh, no, my mom is sending me a, a text. Sorry. I wonder right,

Speaker 2 (01:18):
Emily. Phones away. Oops,

Speaker 3 (01:19):
Sorry. Okay, put it away. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:22):
Yep. Wonder Our first classroom norm is to put our phones away. Thank you, Carlos for that. Does anyone else have an idea of another

Speaker 3 (01:30):
Problem? Um hmm.

Speaker 2 (01:34):
Could raise your hands.

Speaker 3 (01:36):
Oh, um,

Speaker 2 (01:40):
All right. How should we treat others?

Speaker 3 (01:44):
Hmm.

Speaker 2 (01:46):
All right, will eyes forward please sit

Speaker 3 (01:48):
Up. Sorry. Sorry, sorry. Woo, sorry. Spin. Spending little too much time.

Speaker 2 (01:53):
How should we treat others? What did we review

Speaker 3 (01:55):
About that? Um, with

Speaker 2 (02:01):
Respect's

Speaker 3 (02:03):
Respect.

Speaker 2 (02:04):
Great, thank you Mina. So what does respect look like to you all? How do we show respect to others?

Speaker 3 (02:10):
Emily, um, the birthday party today. Oh, sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:17):
Hi Kayla. How do you show respect to others?

Speaker 3 (02:20):
Um, I think, uh, you know, by listening to what they have to say and not talking over or, um, yeah. Right. You're listening respectfully and treating people kindly. Yeah.

Speaker 2 (02:35):
Great. So we can practice active listening that shows respect. So what does active listening look like when we're listening to someone? Oh, yes. Jayla, thank you for raising your hand.

Speaker 3 (02:44):
Yeah, yeah, <laugh>. Sorry about that. Um, so I was getting like focused, you know, like staying focused and looking forward and you know, having your work ready and just being ready to participate, you know, throughout class.

Speaker 2 (02:57):
Yep. That's a great norm that we're coming to class, ready to learn and ready to participate. So we could say that we're coming to class prepared. So does anyone else have any other ideas for norms?

Speaker 3 (03:10):
Oh, I saw finally just saw Iron Man over the weekend. Wow. I can't believe it took me so long to see it. I don't know

Speaker 2 (03:19):
What I've been doing. Alright, Carlos, let's talk about that during lunch or recess. Okay?

Speaker 3 (03:22):
Okay. Okay. No, no problem. No problem. I'll be ready. Sounds

Speaker 2 (03:25):
Good. You brought up a great idea already. A great norm. Do you have any other ideas? Carlos?

Speaker 3 (03:31):
Um hmm. Maybe. Huh? I said the texting already, right? Um, oh,

Speaker 2 (03:41):
You have one, Emily?

Speaker 3 (03:42):
Yeah. Um, I was thinking, um, like being respectful of other people's space and like not, um, running or oh, like touching people's stuff or, you know, stuff like that.

Speaker 2 (04:00):
Yeah, no, I think that's really important. Respecting other people's space and not running. Why do we not run in the classroom? What is that? If, what if we do? That is the class.

Speaker 3 (04:11):
Oh, Mina, is there a book report to you today? Oh,

Speaker 2 (04:14):
No. Well voices off. I,

Speaker 3 (04:16):
Okay. Sorry. Sorry. Yep.

Speaker 2 (04:18):
Thank you. All right. Well Emily said that we're respectful of people's space and that we don't run. So why is that important?

Speaker 3 (04:26):
Um, oh,

Speaker 2 (04:30):
Mina, do you have something? Yes. Yeah,

Speaker 3 (04:31):
I was gonna say cause um, it just keeps everyone safe and, you know, sets boundaries, which is good.

Speaker 2 (04:39):
Great. Safety is so important in the classroom, so that's why we need to make sure

Speaker 3 (04:42):
This is boring. Why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (04:46):
All right, Jayla, let's keep our eyes forward and let's focus into our discussion so that we can move on. But let's set our classroom norms first.

Speaker 3 (04:54):
Okay? Okay. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (04:56):
Do you have any ideas, Jayla?

Speaker 3 (04:59):
Um, no. I think I said focus already, so I'm not like show up on time. Maybe just, I think I said it already.

Speaker 2 (05:06):
Great. We talked about coming to class for reports. That means your materials, that means coming up.

Speaker 3 (05:13):
End simulation. All right, well thank you for your time.
