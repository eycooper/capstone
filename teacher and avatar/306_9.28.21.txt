Speaker 1 (00:00):
Begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:06):
Hello, pla. I hope you had a great time during summer. Did anyone do anything fun? If they wanna raise their hands,

Speaker 1 (00:15):
Um, it's a lot of movies.

Speaker 2 (00:18):
Remember to raise our hands first and then we,

Speaker 1 (00:20):
Sorry. Oops.

Speaker 2 (00:26):
What were you gonna say Jayla?

Speaker 1 (00:29):
Oh, I saw a movie. That's all

Speaker 2 (00:31):
Very cool. So since we're back in the classroom, we kind of wanna go over,

Speaker 1 (00:36):
Sit up

Speaker 2 (00:37):
Back to the classroom

Speaker 1 (00:38):
Sitting, which

Speaker 2 (00:39):
Means listening to the teacher

Speaker 1 (00:41):
Pay attention and paying attention. What,

Speaker 2 (00:46):
Let's look

Speaker 1 (00:47):
First

Speaker 2 (00:47):
Classroom rules. So when we think about being respectful, what are some things that we wanna be respectful about? Raise your hand if you have any ideas.

Speaker 1 (00:59):
Um, um Oh, oh, no. Oh, I'm getting a text. I'm sorry. My mom is sending me a text. Emily,

Speaker 2 (01:13):
Being responsive during class and listening. Respectful thing to do.

Speaker 1 (01:20):
Okay. Yeah, sorry. Yeah. Oops.

Speaker 2 (01:23):
That's okay. Can you think of anything else that we should be respectful to during the classroom?

Speaker 1 (01:28):
Um, other people's opinions, maybe.

Speaker 2 (01:32):
That's a great idea. We wanna make sure that when we're listening to others, that we want to be open-minded to what they have to say to make sure that we hear them and we're active listening. Will, could you tell me what active listening looks like?

Speaker 1 (01:49):
Um, I think, uh, sorry, I'm just kinda, Ugh, it's getting a little sleepy. Sorry about that. It's just up really late last night. I'm sorry. Sorry about that. Sorry. Whew, sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:04):
Could you tell me a few things that active, active listening looks like, how that looks with our bodies and how we can

Speaker 1 (02:12):
Others come to the birthday party later?

Speaker 2 (02:15):
Hey Jayla,

Speaker 1 (02:16):
I'm gonna come later.

Speaker 2 (02:17):
Make sure that we're paying attention towards what the expectations,

Speaker 1 (02:20):
I'm sorry. We were just talking about, uh, birthday party, that's all. I'm sorry about that.

Speaker 2 (02:25):
We talked about that outside of class because we wanna come back from our summer break and actively listen. So Will, were you gonna say something about what active listening looks like and then I'll go over to you after Jayla?

Speaker 1 (02:39):
Probably not falling asleep like I just did. So

Speaker 2 (02:43):
Definitely sometimes we're tired,

Speaker 1 (02:45):
Not active listening,

Speaker 2 (02:46):
But we wanna make sure that we're giving attention towards other people. Yes, Jayla?

Speaker 1 (02:52):
Um, I was thinking showing up on time would be a really good norm. That's would be great work. Um, you know, whenever starting class. Yeah.

Speaker 2 (03:01):
Yeah. That's great. That's how we can be successful. Does anyone else have any ideas?

Speaker 1 (03:06):
Oh, I just wanted to mention, I, you know, I finally got to see Carlos over the weekend

Speaker 2 (03:11):
Before you Go ahead.

Speaker 1 (03:12):
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was gonna say, uh, you know, I really wanted to see Ironman for a long time and uh, finally got to it and, uh, what a treat.

Speaker 2 (03:21):
That's awesome. What a

Speaker 1 (03:22):
Great movie.

Speaker 2 (03:23):
Thinking about being, listening to the conversation. We also wanna stay on topic. So I would love to hear about after class cuz I've also seen that movie.

Speaker 1 (03:32):
Are we ready? No problem.

Speaker 2 (03:34):
Yeah. So I kinda wanna go back to Jayla was saying about being prepared. Emily, do you have any other ideas about being prepared?

Speaker 1 (03:41):
Oh, I was gonna say, um, like being respectful of people's, uh, space. So yeah. Not, you know, running around or, or taking people's things or, or, um, yeah, like stuff like that.

Speaker 2 (03:58):
Exactly right. We wanna be safe because we wanna respect other people's spaces and we wanna make sure that everyone can learn in this environment safely. Does anyone else have any ideas of how we can be

Speaker 1 (04:09):
Safe? Book report to today?

Speaker 2 (04:11):
Hey, will, let's pay attention Yes. To the classroom.

Speaker 1 (04:16):
Okay. Yeah. This notebook report. Well

Speaker 2 (04:19):
Because being respectful means

Speaker 1 (04:20):
I was worried paying

Speaker 2 (04:21):
Attention to each other, but also paying attention to the teachers. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, we can engage.

Speaker 1 (04:25):
Yes. Yes. I

Speaker 2 (04:27):
Agree. Does anyone else have any ideas about being safe? Which is the great idea that Emily brought up.

Speaker 1 (04:34):
This is boring. Why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (04:39):
Jayla? We wanna make sure that we are being respectful for what we're learning in class because we just got off of summer break, we're kind of transitioning back into the classroom. Um, so I wanna make sure that we're all aware of the expectations as we go on with the school year. Do you have any questions about the expectations that we're talking about too? Oh,

Speaker 1 (04:58):
No, no, no. I got it now. I got it Nick. For sure.

Speaker 2 (05:02):
Ideas about how we can be respectful in the classroom.
