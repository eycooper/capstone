Okay, so today we're gonna go over some classroom norms. I have five norms down that I hope will be able, that I hope will be able to use to get through the school year. Um, the first norm is to be respectful and kind to your fellow parents. Inside

Speaker 3 (03:14):
Yeah, that sounds good. Thanks.

Speaker 2 (03:17):
And then the final norm that I have for the class is if and when you need help, just feel free to let me know.

Speaker 3 (03:22):
Oh, oh, I forgot to say I saw Iron Man over break. It was amazing. I wasn't allowed to see Iron Man before, but now my dad thinks I'm old enough. I just, I just wanted to share that.

Speaker 2 (03:49):
Thank you. Okay, so the last and final norm is if you, if and when you need help, feel free to let me know. Do you guys have any questions? Any questions? Yes, Emily?

Speaker 3 (04:06):
Um, well, I was wondering, do you think that we could suggest, um, being, being, being respectful of people's things? Yes. As a norm?

Speaker 2 (04:22):
Yes. We can add that to our first norm about being respectful and kind. I, we can add that.

Speaker 3 (04:29):
Thanks.

Speaker 2 (04:31):
No problem. Any other questions?

Speaker 3 (04:36):
Oh, crap. Mina. Mina. Did we have a book report due today? No. No, I don't think so. Are you sure? Yes. Well, I remember everything.

Speaker 2 (04:48):
Hey, class. Any other questions? Yeah, any questions or you guys understand the classroom norms?

Speaker 3 (04:57):
I think I understand, honestly, this is a little boring. Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (05:09):
Because we wanna create a safe and supportive classroom environment where all our parents can feel, heard and listen to. Wouldn't you wanna be in a classroom where you feel like you can be yourself and do what would you do? Do what you like

Speaker 3 (05:26):
End simulation.
