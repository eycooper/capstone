Speaker 1 (02:35):
Okay. Thank you. Gotcha. Thank, sorry about that.

Speaker 2 (02:38):

Speaker 1 (02:47):
Yeah, I was gonna say like, yeah, classroom norm. I would be showing up on time and, uh, being ready to, to work baby. I don't know.

Speaker 2 (02:56):
Yeah. That's awesome. Does anybody else, is anybody else able to think of other classroom norms that we might have forgotten about over vacation now?

Speaker 1 (03:04):
Oh, uh, you know, I finally got to see the first Ironman Carlos. It was pretty,

Speaker 2 (03:09):
You got to raise your hand if you'd like to speak.

Speaker 1 (03:11):
Oh, okay, sure. Well, uh, I saw that, um, first Ironman movie over the weekend. It was pretty, it was pretty cool. That's all. I just wanted to share that. I don't know. I'm not really in superhero movies, but this one was, this one was pretty, pretty good.

Speaker 2 (03:27):
So I'm glad you liked it. Does anybody else wanna add anything?

Speaker 1 (03:33):
Um,

Speaker 2 (03:34):
Yes, Emily?

Speaker 1 (03:36):
Yeah, I think maybe like a good norm or, or a rule would be if we like respected other people's space and like, didn't, you know, take people's stuff that isn't ours and yeah, just be like, don't get in anyone's personal space and stuff like that.

Speaker 2 (04:01):
So yeah. That's a great role. Does anybody else have any other rules?

Speaker 1 (04:07):
Was anything due today? No. It's the first day back from vacation. Will Oh, we didn't have anything due. You sure? No. Like a book reporter or anything? Yeah, we didn't have anything due today, did we? I just, I was just thinking, I thought we had something to do. Did we? Yeah.

Speaker 2 (04:22):
No, we didn't have anything to do. But if you'd like to wonder that next step, appreciate if you just raise your hand and I'd be able to call on you and you're able to ask your

Speaker 1 (04:29):
Question. Okay. Yeah. Sorry, I had a little must been that nap I took before. It's

Speaker 2 (04:33):
Okay. Everybody's so excited from coming back from their break.

Speaker 1 (04:36):
Gotcha.

Speaker 2 (04:37):
Understand.

Speaker 1 (04:38):
Yeah. This is boring. Uh, why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (04:43):
Because it's good to remind ourselves what's classroom behavior and what's outside classroom behavior. Okay. And we wanna be able to respect each other and what everybody's doing, what everybody has to bring to the conversation. So we wanna make sure we're step each other's toes.

Speaker 1 (04:55):
Makes sense. Okay. Thanks.

Speaker 2 (04:58):
It's okay to wanna share and it's okay to wanna talk and I know everybody gets really excited, but whenever that happens, we still to remember that other people may be speaking and other people still to say

Speaker 1 (05:07):
Hello. End simulation. All right.
