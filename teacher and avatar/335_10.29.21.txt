Go to sleep. Oh, I see that. I really appreciate that you were really being thoughtful about, you know, the people sitting next to you, but it sounds like Thank you. Will says he, he is paying attention, so let's, let's trust him when he says that. But I do appreciate that you are trying to make sure that he was, you know, paying attention. Appreciate that. Anyone else? I'm sorry. Oh,

I'm so excited that everyone's, you know, ha has a lot of fun stuff going on. Emily, uh, would you like to, uh, share? Is there anything that you had, uh, in the past, uh, couple days or something coming up you're looking forward to?

I, I'm not really so much in comic books, but, but, but I, I watched it and I am hooked, you know, that Robert Don Jr. Is something. So, uh, but yeah, just, just a little, little movie review for y'all, that's all.

Speaker 3 (03:31):
Yeah. Uh, so it sounds like, uh, some other folks, uh, we're watching movies, uh, too. Will, uh, Nina, I'm curious, would you like to share anything, uh, from the, the past, uh, couple days in the holiday or what you might have coming up that you're excited about? Oh,

Speaker 2 (03:46):
Um, well, uh, I think, um, you know, we're gonna get a new cat at our house, so that should be fun. Oh

Speaker 3 (03:53):
My gosh. Is there a name?

Speaker 2 (03:54):
Yeah, it should be fun out at the end. You mean to say that's what's going on with this?

Speaker 3 (04:02):
No. Yeah. You'll have to tell us if, if you come up with a name. Oh my gosh. Well, before we go on, something I wanna talk about is Nina,

Speaker 2 (04:10):
Uh, Nina. Did I forget my book report? Do we have a book report due today?

Speaker 3 (04:14):
Oh, will

Speaker 2 (04:14):
Have a book report.

Speaker 3 (04:16):
Very, very important that you're thinking about your book

Speaker 2 (04:19):
Report. Yeah. I just forgot, I, I thought I forgot something. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Speaker 3 (04:24):
Oh, no worries. No worries. Why, why don't you write that down, or, you know what? I'll even write it down. Okay. Uh, Will's book report, and we'll see if we can't check on that later. Cause there's something really, really important I'd like to talk about with y'all. Um, so as we're coming back, I just wanna make sure that we all remember some of the classroom norm set up. Oh, Jayla. Yes.

Speaker 2 (04:43):
Gotcha. I, I just had a question. This is, uh, please. It's kinda boring. Why are we, why are we doing this?

Speaker 3 (04:50):
Oh, why are we talking about classroom norms? That's a really good question. Yeah. And you know what? I think that's a really good point. A lot of us might think it's kind of boring to talk about classroom norms. We've already talked about it before the beginning of the year, so it's like, why do we need to talk about this again? Well, I think for some people, you know, maybe they've forgotten about it or, oh, oh, hey, there.
