Speaker 1 (00:00):
So, uh, we'll begin simulation. Hi Eric.

Speaker 2 (00:11):
Hello, friends. So today we're gonna go over some norms, um, our, in our classroom. Just a reminder of what it's like to be in the classroom. Hmm. So, Nina, can you tell me, um, what it means to be kind and courteous?

Speaker 1 (00:27):
Oh. Um, I think they treat people the way they wanna be treated, you know?

Speaker 2 (00:34):
Very true.

Speaker 1 (00:36):
Sit up. What

Speaker 2 (00:39):
Somina do you think that we could have been a little bit kinder to Will?

Speaker 1 (00:43):
Oh, I'm sorry. I just wanna make sure he was paying attention. Oh yeah,

Speaker 2 (00:47):
That is totally okay. Just remember there's a way to be respectful when we're asking someone to do something, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, that's where our kind and courteous skills come

Speaker 1 (00:55):
In. That's right.

Speaker 2 (00:57):
Now can anybody tell me what, um, listening skills we can use in our class today?

Speaker 1 (01:03):
Um, oh no. Oh dear. I'm sorry. My mom is texting. Oh. Oh dear. She said I forgot something at home. Oh, no,

Speaker 2 (01:12):
That's okay. Emily, do you just wanna take a moment? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1 (01:17):
Jayla [inaudible] call me back.

Speaker 2 (01:20):
Yeah. Alright. Probably put the phone away, right?

Speaker 1 (01:23):
Okay. Yeah, I think she did that.

Speaker 2 (01:26):
All right. Jayla, can you tell me what listening skills are that we can use in the classroom?

Speaker 1 (01:29):
Oh, sure. I think, you know, speaking, um, yeah, after you raise your hand, um, you know, stuff like that,

Speaker 2 (01:36):
I think. Exactly. Will, or Carlos, do you have anything to add?

Speaker 1 (01:42):
Uh hmm. I think, uh, maybe we already said no cell phones. I think showing up on time is important, you know, and being ready to work. Hmm.

Speaker 2 (01:53):
So, will, do you think that you're using your active listening skills right now?

Speaker 1 (01:58):
Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I stayed up so late last night. I apologize. I'm, I'm here, I'm awake. It

Speaker 2 (02:04):
It's okay. It's the day after break friends, so sometimes we're gonna be a little bit tired and not be able to That's right. Right. Are you gonna hear, all right. So can anybody tell me what being respectful means? Do you think that goes along with being kind and courteous and actively

Speaker 1 (02:17):
Listening? Um, I think I can go, yeah.

Speaker 2 (02:21):
And feel free to raise your hand to answer so that way we're not all talking at once.

Speaker 1 (02:25):
Oh. Oh, okay. Sorry about that. Um, oh, I guess I'll

Speaker 2 (02:30):
Jayla go ahead. What is chime

Speaker 1 (02:32):
In with one? Um, yeah, so I was thinking, uh, you know, maybe to sort of bounce on, I think what Carlos said, I think, you know, have one person talking to the Italian and uh, I think we talked about respectful language, so maybe, uh, yeah. How about something simple like no eating in class, that can be really distracting, I think. Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2 (02:54):
<affirmative>. Exactly. I agree. Does anybody else have anything they wanna add?

Speaker 1 (03:01):
Uh oh. Um, I finally saw the first Ironman movie. Everybody, I, I, I just had resisted for so long and I just wanted to say it was awesome. So that's

Speaker 2 (03:14):
Alright. Well thank you Carlos. I'm glad to hear that. Sure. Probably not the conversation for this time. Right.

Speaker 1 (03:19):
Oh, okay.

Speaker 2 (03:21):
That's ok. Sometimes

Speaker 1 (03:22):
Talk about that.

Speaker 2 (03:23):
It's ok. Gotcha. Just need reminders. Can you tell me what being respectful is in the classroom?

Speaker 1 (03:28):
Um, I think it's listening, you know, to people when they're talking and participating and, you know, kinda working together as a team. Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2 (03:35):
<affirmative>. All right. Oh, does anybody else have any questions or comments on our different classroom norms? Yes, Emily?

Speaker 1 (03:44):
Yeah. Uh, I think, you know, um, being respectful of other people's like bodies and space. Uh, so, so like, don't take things that aren't yours or, you know, like run around or push someone, you know, just kinda safe bodies I guess would be the be

Speaker 2 (04:07):
The Right. Exactly. Safe bodies is another thing that we use in the classroom, not homework interrupting. Do you have something you wanted to, to, um, talk to us about Will?

Speaker 1 (04:17):
Oh no, I was just asking, I was asking Mina, who's not answering me, um, about if we had anything due today, but I guess we don't if it was vacations, so. Alright, well

Speaker 2 (04:27):
Sorry, this is probably not the time to ask Mina about any homework assignments. Right. Okay. I think that I could wait a few minutes.

Speaker 1 (04:32):
I can wait. Sure.

Speaker 2 (04:34):
All, and we'll go over that later. So don't worry.

Speaker 1 (04:36):
This is, um, boring. Why are we doing,

Speaker 2 (04:41):
Um, well, Jayla, sometimes we just need reminders of things that we need to do in the classroom and you guys have been on break, so we just wanna go over the classroom norms and make sure everybody still understands and remembers what to do. So that's why we go over them.

Speaker 1 (04:54):
I gotcha. That makes sense. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, sorry. Cool.

Speaker 2 (04:58):
No, thank you for asking. Jayla. Is there anybody else that has any questions about active listening or being, finding courteous or any of our classroom norms

Speaker 1 (05:07):
In simulation?
