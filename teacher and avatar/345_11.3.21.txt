Speaker 1 (00:00):
For your session to begin. So we will begin simulation. Hi there.

Speaker 2 (00:13):
Hi.

Speaker 1 (00:16):
How was your vacation?

Speaker 2 (00:18):
Um, it was good. I had a relaxing,

Speaker 1 (00:34):
So, yeah, well sit up. Wait, I'm sitting here. What are you talking about? No, you don't look like you're paying attention. You know, she's afraid to say something. Cause

Speaker 2 (00:45):
You just, okay. So we're gonna, we're gonna go over, I'm

Speaker 1 (00:49):
Comfortable,

Speaker 2 (00:52):
We're gonna go over some rules and norms to implement in the classroom this year. So the first one is that we are going to be a community, we're gonna be inclusive of each other, and we should all be working together as a team.

Speaker 1 (01:09):
Oh, no, I'm sorry. My mom is texting me. I think I, oh no, I think I left my lunch at home. Hold on. I'm sorry. Wait.

Speaker 2 (01:21):
Let's go over these norms and then let's put away the phone Okay. And then address that later. Sure,

Speaker 1 (01:27):
Sure, sure. Okay.

Speaker 2 (01:29):
Okay. The next one is having respect for one another and for me. So that kind of goes hand in hand with electronics away. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, and it also kind of goes into the next rule, which is, is there a problem? Will

Speaker 1 (01:47):
What? Oh, I'm sorry. I Oh, oh geez. Yeah.

Speaker 2 (01:51):
Let's,

Speaker 1 (01:52):
I stayed up. I stayed up Brilliant. Late last night. I'm sorry. I'm, I'm awake now. Sorry about that talk.

Speaker 2 (01:57):
Let's pay attention.

Speaker 1 (01:59):
Yeah. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:00):
The third rule is listening to others and being attentive, whether it's during class discussion. You gonna, to my birthday group work? Lectures

Speaker 1 (02:10):
Is three 30. Yeah. Three 30. Trampoline park.

Speaker 2 (02:15):
Okay. So let's not be thinking about when we get out of class, but let's be present in the here and now. The fourth rule is that we're gonna always follow my directions as the teacher. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I wanna help you on your educational journey. And, um, by following my directions, you'll come out, um, by hopefully learning a lot, so mm-hmm. <affirmative> following directions, and again, being respectful. Yes.

Speaker 1 (02:42):
Yeah. I think a good one would be also like, always being prepared and kind of ready to mm-hmm. <affirmative> work at the beginning of every day, like having your reading done and stuff like that, just so you're, you know, ready to contribute.

Speaker 2 (02:55):
Absolutely. And that kind of goes along with my last rule. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> is, um, to always try your best and always, I only expect you to get a hundred percent or an A on everything, but I expect, um, a hundred percent effort. And so that goes along with being prepared, doing your readings, whatever. Yeah.

Speaker 1 (03:14):
I, oh, so I wanted to mention, I finally got to see, uh, the, uh, Leah first Iron Man movie, uh, over the weekend, which was really something. Um, I don't know if anyone else has seen it, but just wanted to put it out there. It is. Excellent. I've been missing out, so.

Speaker 2 (03:29):
Okay. Yeah. That's not, that's actually kind of breaking one of our class rules, bringing up that right now, not being attention. Okay. Right now to this conversation. That's something great to talk about, maybe at recess, but that's not, that's not in the conversation right now. Yes. Emily?

Speaker 1 (03:45):
Um, I think maybe an important norm or rule would be, uh, like respecting personal space. You know, like don't take things from other people, um, without asking, uh, respect, personal space, no. Running, you know, just kinda, um, you know. Yeah.

Speaker 2 (04:05):
And that goes both ways. Sure. All respect your space and you respect mine. Um, again, we're communities, so I, I now wanna hear about what you guys have to say about what rules and norms that maybe you want in this classroom. Cuz it's yours too.

Speaker 1 (04:26):
Hmm. Like,

Speaker 2 (04:29):
Yes, Carlos.

Speaker 1 (04:30):
I think a good one is like asking if you need help. Um, you know, uh, if you're having difficulty with something.

Speaker 2 (04:37):
Definitely. Yeah. That's why I'm here. I'm here to help you.

Speaker 1 (04:40):
This is boring. Why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (04:45):
Because these are the guidelines that are gonna lead our whole rest of our year so we can meet productive in a cohesive classroom. Gotcha. And help this whole year be way more fun and also help guide our learning.

Speaker 1 (04:59):
I got

Speaker 2 (04:59):
You. Let's not use that language.

Speaker 1 (05:02):
Oh, okay. I understand. Thank you. All right.
