Speaker 1 (02:13):
Everyone? Let's remember to be listening to Will as he gives his response. Will, do you have anything to share?

Speaker 2 (02:19):
Um, uh, uh, I guess like, don't fall asleep in class.

Speaker 1 (02:24):
Don't fall asleep in class. That's a good first step. What else might, what might show a classmate? That

Speaker 2 (02:33):
Sounds good.

Speaker 1 (02:34):
What else might show a classmate that we're listening to them? Carlos, do you have any ideas?

Speaker 2 (02:40):
Um, I think everybody, you know, being quiet, um, when they're supposed to and like letting one person, um, talk at once is good. I

Speaker 1 (02:49):
Think that's great point. Thank you Carlos for that. Yeah. So one of the important things that we, how we show listening is by when someone else is talking, we are quiet. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> and way when we can hear what they have to say. And then when it's time for us to talk, we can share and everyone else will listen to us. Right? Right. That's a big one. How about participating?

Speaker 2 (03:08):
Oh, oh, you know what? I just wanted to mention. I just saw Ironman over the weekend and like, it really lived up to the hype. I don't know why.

Speaker 1 (03:19):
Oh, that's awesome, Carlos. Thanks for sharing that. Let's continue our problem discussion norms right now and actually leading into a really great

Speaker 2 (03:25):
Marvel movies.

Speaker 1 (03:27):
How, what does it look like for us to stay on task?

Speaker 2 (03:32):
Um,

Speaker 1 (03:33):
Emily, do you have something to share? Go ahead.

Speaker 2 (03:37):
So all your stuff ready, like you're reading done and

Speaker 1 (03:44):
Yeah. You're bringing up bringing, not being,

Speaker 2 (03:45):
Um, devices and, and or running or touching

Speaker 1 (03:49):
People's things. Good. That's good. So not doing something that we're not supposed to be doing during class, like being on our phones. That's right. And making sure that we're not making, doing anything disruptive, like running or touching other people during class. That brings us off task. And when we're in class, we're on, we're on task. Cuz we need to learn. That's great. How about collaboration? Does anyone tell me what collaboration

Speaker 2 (04:10):
Looks, looks like in class today?

Boring. Why are we

Speaker 1 (04:41):
Doing this? Oh, why are we doing this? That's a great question. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Cause when we e established our classroom norms, we are establishing the way that we respect each other and work well together. That's really important for all of us to feel comfortable, huh?

Yeah, yeah. No, no, no. I hear you. Makes

Speaker 1 (04:57):
