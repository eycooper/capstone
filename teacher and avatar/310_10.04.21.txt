Speaker 2 (02:31):

Speaker 1 (02:45):
Um, yeah, it means like, um, being nice and letting other people talk and don't interrupt and stuff. Like, uh,

Speaker 2 (02:53):
Yeah. Thank you Jayla. And did you guys show me that respect while I was speaking?

Speaker 1 (03:00):

Speaker 1 (03:25):
Oh, okay. Okay, teacher, sorry.

Speaker 2 (03:28):
Um, okay, so the first norm is, again, being respectful. The second norm, um, is communication. So you guys need to ask help when needed and use me as a resource. Like I'm the best resource. I know how, yes, Emily.

Speaker 1 (03:49):
Um, I just wanted to say like, with, um, the respect, it should like, include like, not running, not touching other people's things.
