Hi, Mina. Welcome. Welcome to class. It's great to see all of you

Speaker 1 (00:39):

Speaker 2 (00:40):
So you

Speaker 1 (00:40):
Need to speak up. You're like way too quiet. Hey

Speaker 2 (00:45):
Mina, can you hear me?

Speaker 1 (00:46):
Yes. Oh yeah, I can, I can. So

Speaker 2 (00:49):
We're gonna talk about some class expectations. Um, what's an expectation?

Speaker 1 (00:54):
Sit up straight.

Speaker 2 (00:56):
Mina straight. Well sit up straight. That's an example. Okay. Yeah. But we don't need to, we don't need to suggest things to our classmates. Okay. Our first rule and expectation in this class is to respect others. Okay. So by respecting others, we don't necessarily need to correct them. We can let the teacher do that. When someone's talking, we put our eyes on them. Okay. Eye contact and refrain. Not talking to others while the teacher is talking. While other, while others are talking. Okay.

Speaker 1 (01:27):
I keep texting. Sorry

Speaker 2 (01:29):
Emily. I'm so glad you're doing that because our second expectation in this class is no phones. Our phones have to be away.

Speaker 1 (01:38):
That's

Speaker 2 (01:38):
Awesome. Yeah. So, Emily,

Speaker 1 (01:40):
Can you like about, um, what's

Speaker 2 (01:44):
It, one second. Carlos, Emily, I need you to put your phone away. Okay?

Speaker 1 (01:48):
Okay. I can doing it. Turn

Speaker 2 (01:49):
It off. Okay. Thank you. We're gonna turn our phones off when we come to class and we're gonna put them away. Yeah. Okay. Um, there might be different expectations in other classes, but in this class we're not gonna use our phones. Okay, Carlos? Cool.

Speaker 1 (02:01):
So can, so I was thinking like we can have like a, like a science competition or something. I dunno if you're interested in that

Speaker 2 (02:07):
At all, but, um, this is a social studies classroom, so don't tell me to sit up. Maybe you can, uh, talk to your science teacher now. Will Mina Sorry. Our third expectation in this class and I need eyes on me. Mina.

Speaker 1 (02:21):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (02:21):
I need eyes on me. Okay. When I'm speaking is when we have something to share. We want to hear others' voices, but we need to raise our hands. Okay? Okay. So if you have something you'd like to share with the class to tell the teacher, why don't we raise our hands? Okay. And then when the teacher calls on you, you can share what you have to say with the class. Are there any questions about these expectations?

Speaker 1 (02:44):
Makes sense?

Speaker 2 (02:45):
Okay. Makes sense? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Uh, Mina, you were shaking your head.

Speaker 1 (02:49):
Oh, no, no, no.

Speaker 2 (02:51):
You got it. Okay. Well, what did, uh, let's practice raising our hands and listening to others. Okay. What did, I'd like someone to tell me what they did this weekend.

Speaker 1 (03:03):
Uh,

Speaker 2 (03:04):
Carlos.

Speaker 1 (03:05):
Yeah. So, uh, basically I just sort of brainstormed about, uh, the science fair and, uh, came up with like a bunch of really cool ideas and I was thinking like we could all do like a, like a volcano competition. Um, as like a saying. I dunno. I just try to insert fun things.

Speaker 2 (03:23):
That's interesting and I love your creativity and really cool. The passion that you have for science Yeah.
