Hi. Good morning, class. How are you guys?

Speaker 1 (00:11):
Hi there. Good, good.

Speaker 2 (00:13):
Um, so today we're gonna talk about some behavioral expectations. So I'm gonna, um, give you guys some examples of some, and then we're gonna talk about why you think those might be important.

Speaker 1 (00:28):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (00:29):
So my first expectation for you guys is to use kind words. Yeah. So why do you think that might be important? Well,

Speaker 1 (00:38):

Speaker 1 (00:57):
Thief.

Speaker 2 (00:58):
All let's, let's focus back in. Why do you guys think, um, using kind words might be important?

Speaker 1 (01:05):
Um, well, oh, oh, sorry. Um, well, it helps to, we help, uh, like support each other that way, I would say.

Speaker 2 (01:13):

Speaker 1 (01:18):
Yes.

Speaker 2 (01:19):
Stop using your phone right now. Okay. Let's just put it away. Thank you. Let's focus back in on our discussion. That was a great answer, Jayla. Um, thanks. So it will help us build a stronger classroom community when we use kind words with each other.

Speaker 1 (01:35):
Oh, I wanted to mention, um, so I wrote a, a screenplay based upon, uh, one of these superheroes that I like to make up at my spare time. And I didn't know if anyone wanted to like, do a readthrough of it, uh, later on or something. I just kinda have this new project. I'd love to get everyone at all.

Speaker 2 (01:52):
Okay, Carlos, thanks. Thanks for sharing that with us. Let's stay, let's sure. Uh, stay on track and maybe we can talk about that some later. Alright, so my next,

Speaker 1 (02:02):
I got the com I have the copies for

Speaker 2 (02:03):
Everyone. Okay. My next behavioral expectation is to make

Speaker 1 (02:07):
Your

Speaker 2 (02:07):
Pen safe choices.

Speaker 1 (02:09):
Well, you totally took my pen. I saw

Speaker 2 (02:11):
Hey, will and Mina.

Speaker 1 (02:12):
Yeah. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:15):
Let's focus in on discussion and not talk, not talk to each other.

Speaker 1 (02:19):
She said not to talk will. Okay.

Speaker 2 (02:22):
Sure. Okay. Thank you guys. So make safe choices. Why do you think that might be important?

Speaker 1 (02:30):
Um, well, did you say make safe choices? Is that what you said? Yep. Um, well, you know, we wanna be able to do well and not put ourselves at risk. I don't, I don't

Speaker 2 (02:46):
Know. Yeah. What are some examples of some safe choices?

Speaker 1 (02:51):
Um, not running or throwing thin things or calling anyone a name. It's, yeah. Unflattering.

Speaker 2 (02:58):
Exactly. Emily, that's an awesome answer. So just using our materials and our bodies responsibly in the

Speaker 1 (03:07):
Classroom. Oh, I meant to ask. What about, uh, the science fair this year? Are you in charge of that? Or who is charge of Carlos? Like a science junkie?

Speaker 2 (03:15):
We're gonna

Speaker 1 (03:16):
Science junkie

Speaker 2 (03:18):
Are some, those are some good questions, some good points to bring up. But right now we're gonna focus on talking about Okay. Some of our expectations.

Speaker 1 (03:25):
Cool.

Speaker 2 (03:26):
Um, all ears. Okay. My third one that I wanna talk about with you guys is to listen while others are speaking. And why do you think that one might be important?

Speaker 1 (03:38):
Um, because, uh, we'll, we'll, we'll be able to learn from each other and, um, hear each other's like thoughts and opinion opinions and share ideas.

Speaker 2 (03:51):
Yeah.

Speaker 1 (03:51):
This is boring. Why aren't we doing this? Sorry.

Speaker 2 (03:55):
That's okay. Why? Um, we're doing this so that we can build a stronger community as a classroom. And like Will said, we have a lot to learn from each other. Um, and so that's a, that's why we're talking about kind of our expectations for the classroom so that we can make sure everyone has, um, a good experience in class every day. Okay. That we can learn how to work together.

Speaker 1 (04:21):
All right.

Speaker 2 (04:22):
But great answer. Will.

Speaker 1 (04:23):
I think something should be don't steal. What do you think? Will, I think you're just being mean. Hey, Nina, which part of your name

Speaker 2 (04:34):
Will Hey, will

Speaker 1 (04:38):
What? Sorry.

Speaker 2 (04:39):
Let's focus back in and we can have a discussion about the pencil stealing incident later, but let's focus in right now on our expectations. Okay. And I understand that you guys are frustrated about that, but remember that one of our expectations we just talked about was use kind words. So we'll talk a little bit more with

Speaker 1 (05:00):
That, a few grades,

Speaker 2 (05:03):
And that's okay. That's okay. And that's why we're gonna have a discussion about it later. Um, does anyone else have,

Speaker 1 (05:11):
And, and okay.
