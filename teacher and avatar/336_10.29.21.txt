Speaker 2 (00:55):
Hi. Okay, back up. Your eyes on. Okay. Okay. So I wanna go over some strategies that we're gonna talk about today, about what we're gonna do when we're listening to teacher and how we can be respectful in the classroom. Does that sound cool?

Speaker 1 (01:10):
Ok. Yeah. I'm sorry. My mom is, um, sending me a text. I'm sorry. I must have left something at home. I'm sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:17):

Speaker 1 (01:26):
Oh, yeah. Okay.

Speaker 2 (01:28):
Awesome. Next thing we wanna do is stay seated when mm-hmm. <affirmative> teacher is talking and when teacher is giving a lesson. Is that understood?

Speaker 1 (02:38):
Okay? Oh,

Speaker 2 (02:40):
Yes, Jayla.

Speaker 1 (02:42):
Um, I have a good, like, classroom norm. Maybe we give you, um, maybe like everybody shows up prepared and like, ready to work, you don't have your homework done, and, uh, stuff like that, you know, so we're all ready to kind of start off on the same page.

Speaker 2 (02:56):
Yes. That's a great one. That's a great, thank you. Cool. Let's see, another norm. Let's make sure we also, um, have all of our materials ready in front of us. That way we don't have to get up and around the room.

Speaker 1 (03:08):
Oh, oh, I wanted to mention in, I finally got to see the first Ironman movie, which, which I just never got around to it and I just thought it was awesome. I don't know if anybody else did, but I just wanna put that out there. Yeah. So, cool. Thank

Speaker 2 (03:20):
You for sharing. Carlos. I wanna say No problem, problem to raise your hand if you have anything else you wanna share or if you have any questions. Okay.

Speaker 1 (03:28):
Yes. Oh, yes, of course. I'm sorry, I forgot. Sorry about that. That's okay. Gotcha.

Speaker 2 (03:34):
Okay. I think there some other classroom norms. Does anybody else have any classroom norms they wanna add to my list?

Speaker 1 (03:40):
I do,

Speaker 2 (03:40):
I do. Ok, Anna?

Speaker 1 (03:43):
Um, I think it's important to, you know, be respectful of people's space and like, you know, don't touch things that are yours, Stevie, no running or, or pushing or just be respectful of for those students. I think

Speaker 2 (03:57):
That is a great classroom Norm, does everybody understand what Emily's trying to say?

Speaker 1 (04:03):
Oh yeah. No, I totally do. Oh, Mina did, did we have a anything to today? Good book report? No. Well, is that first day after vacation

Speaker 2 (04:13):
About a, um, classroom norm you think would be okay?

Speaker 1 (04:16):
Oh, you know what, I was just talking to Mina because I was worried that I, like we had an assignment. Do we have anything to do today? I, I, for some reason, maybe it's when I fell asleep before, I thought we had a book record or something. <laugh>.

Speaker 2 (04:26):
I don't

Speaker 1 (04:27):
Remember. Okay. I'm slow today. <laugh>. Okay. That is ok. Sorry about that.

Speaker 2 (04:34):
Hmm.

Speaker 1 (04:35):
Let see. This is boring. Why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (04:40):
Oh, yes, we wanna do this because it's just a reminder of the rules that that way we can all be healthy and happy students. That way we can learn to our, our best experience and everything like that.

Speaker 1 (04:51):
Gotcha. No problem. Sounds good. Oh, um, oh, norm?

Speaker 2 (04:59):
Yes, Jayla.

Speaker 1 (05:00):
Thank you. Yeah, so maybe we could, um, I don't know. It could.

Speaker 3 (05:06):
Alright, well that was abrupt, but thank you, uh, for completing your simulation.
