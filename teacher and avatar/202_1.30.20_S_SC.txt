Speaker 1 (00:02):
Okay, go ahead.

Speaker 2 (00:03):
Okay.

Speaker 3 (00:04):
And stop simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:08):
Hi. Good morning, class. How are you guys?

Speaker 1 (00:13):
Hi teacher.

Speaker 2 (00:14):
Hi. Um, I'm Ms. Martin. Um, and today that we, we are gonna be going over just some behavioral expectations for our class. I know it's like the first week of school here. And so I just want us to kind of start off with some ground, um, expectations of what to kind of, uh, go over while we are learning throughout this year. Um, so does it, can anybody raise their hand and tell me, um, any type of classroom expectations they've maybe had in past

Speaker 1 (00:42):
Your science project

Speaker 3 (00:44):
Together

Speaker 1 (00:44):
Yet? Cause you should really

Speaker 2 (00:45):
Start. Are we?

Speaker 1 (00:47):
I didn't have our science.

Speaker 2 (00:48):
Hi, will and Nina. Hi. Can you tell me, can you raise your hand and tell me, um, what type of classroom expectations you've had in the past will, have you had any classroom expectations in the past? Maybe some rules that teachers have gone over with you in the past? Um,

Speaker 3 (01:09):
Yeah,

Speaker 1 (01:10):
I mean, we, uh, we can raise your hand and stuff.

Speaker 2 (01:16):
Yeah. Does anybody else have any ideas of, um, what they would like to see as our classroom expectations for this year?

Speaker 1 (01:24):
Text Carlo. Hi mom. It's my mom. Text.

Speaker 2 (01:31):
One of the classroom rules that I would like to see from you guys is respecting others, and that can mean active listening. So as teachers are talking, um, I'd like to make sure that we're all active. Listen, like Jayla a great job.

Speaker 1 (01:47):
I wanted to get, cause we, um, I remember all the, from last year and I can give you a whole list of everything. Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2 (01:53):
<affirmative>, do you have one that you specifically guys

Speaker 1 (01:58):
And, um, come to class?

Speaker 2 (02:01):
Yeah,

Speaker 1 (02:01):
I mean, I can give you the whole list. Do you want the

Speaker 2 (02:03):
Whole list? That's okay right now. I like that one. So another one coming to class prepared. So coming to class prepared and making sure that you, um, are ready to learn and are showing respect to your classmates. Um, and then another one that I also like, um, is to make sure that we are, um, listening to our classmates as they're sharing their experiences or sharing their, um, their work with you and making sure that we're not, um, talking over the teacher as your Mina. What were some of my classroom rules?

Speaker 3 (02:48):
I think you said like, um, I don't remember. I'm

Speaker 2 (02:53):
Talking to her. I know. So that's gonna be one of the, as well too, is making sure that we're listening to the teacher, um, eyes are on the teacher. That's part of our respect. Um, respecting the teacher and making sure that we're listening when, um, others are talking. So that's not even just me as a teacher, but also

Speaker 1 (03:10):
We're gonna talk about the science fair. I really wanna present my topic to you. I wanna make sure it's okay. So I can you start on

Speaker 2 (03:17):
Carlos? We can, we can do that later for sure, but right now we're going over just some classroom expectations.

Speaker 1 (03:23):
Right? Okay. But I wanna talk about my topic.

Speaker 2 (03:25):
We can do that later. Carlos does, does that work for you? Okay. We'll do it after this. Okay. Okay. So we had respecting others, listening to others, and then, um, making sure that we're coming to class prepared. Um, does anybody have any other classroom expectations that they'd like to add to that list? Yes. Mina, thank you for raising your hand. Be kind. Is that what you're saying? Yeah. I really do like that one as well too. Um, that can also go under respecting others. So we're respecting others by being kind and listening. This

Speaker 1 (04:04):
Is boring. Why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (04:08):
And then also making sure that we're not, um, we're not talking out loud when the teacher is talking. Jayla, do you think that that is a respectful behavior to make to say that, um, that this is kind boring

Speaker 1 (04:22):
About my science fair picture? I'm gonna tell the principal

Speaker 3 (04:26):
That project you

Speaker 2 (04:28):
Nina, eyes up here.

Speaker 1 (04:33):
Oh my gosh.

Speaker 3 (04:35):
Shell

Speaker 1 (04:36):
Not be quiet. And she keeps bothering my science fair.

Speaker 2 (04:39):
I know. I'm, that's a really

Speaker 3 (04:41):
Good topic for him. And he'll

Speaker 2 (04:43):
Listen, <laugh>. I know, but right now we're not talking about our science fair projects. We'll talk about our science fair projects later. Okay. Right now we, right now we're doing our classroom expectations and we've got our three classroom rules. Um, so making sure that we are creating that positive environment, um, that's what I'd like to, to do here. So let's all, uh, make sure that we're listening. So we're doing our active listening. So what are some good examples of active list? Okay. And.
