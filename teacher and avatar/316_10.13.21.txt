Speaker 1 (00:01):
Begin simulation. Hi teacher.

Speaker 2 (00:07):
Hi.

Speaker 1 (00:10):
How was your vacation?

Speaker 2 (00:13):
It was great. How was y'all's?

Speaker 1 (00:16):
Good.

Speaker 2 (00:17):
Good,

Speaker 1 (00:18):
Good, good.

Speaker 3 (00:19):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

Speaker 2 (00:20):
Awesome. Well, we're gonna go over some classroom norms today for the rest of the year. Does that sound like a plan?

Speaker 1 (00:28):
Oh yeah. I mean, and um, I think we should have one of, uh, no cell phones.

Speaker 2 (00:34):
That's a great one, Carlos. Yeah, we can definitely add that. Do y'all have any other suggestions?

Speaker 3 (00:44):
Yeah,

Speaker 1 (00:46):
You need to sit up straight. Sit up straight. I am sitting up straight.

Speaker 3 (00:51):
Sh

Speaker 1 (00:52):
You need to pay attention. You need to pay attention. Will, are you listening

Speaker 3 (00:57):
To me?

Speaker 1 (00:59):
I am listening. Nina. Quiet.

Speaker 2 (01:03):
Hey Will. Nina, let's focus on the task we have at hand, okay?

Speaker 3 (01:08):
Okay. Teacher.

Speaker 2 (01:09):
Yeah. So some other, um, classroom norms that I was thinking besides Carlos mentioning no cell phones. What about respecting others, whether they're space or their opinions? Does that sound like a good one to add?

Speaker 3 (01:23):
Sending text. Oops.

Speaker 1 (01:29):
What she wants got something at her, I think.

Speaker 3 (01:34):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Oh,

Speaker 1 (01:35):
She's texting

Speaker 3 (01:36):
Me again.

Speaker 1 (01:37):
My mom is sending me a

Speaker 3 (01:38):
Text.

Speaker 2 (01:40):
Oh no. Well, Emily, let's phone away. Okay. And let's, it's all good. What about following directions the first time

Speaker 1 (01:53):
I stayed up too late last night, I'm sleeping.

Speaker 2 (02:00):
Oh, no. Well, well let's keep on focus on the task at hand. Okay? Okay.

Speaker 3 (02:06):
And

Speaker 2 (02:06):
Then maybe we can have a brain break later.

Speaker 1 (02:08):
Hey Emily, are you gonna go to jump today?

Speaker 3 (02:11):
Um, I dunno, but I definitely

Speaker 1 (02:14):
Coming to your birthday

Speaker 3 (02:15):
Party.

Speaker 1 (02:16):
Okay, good. Well, I'll tell my mom you're gonna come, but let's go to jump, um, if we can. Yeah. Hey, Kayla, up there. Come meet at the flag pole.

Speaker 2 (02:25):
Let's talk about classroom norms. Okay. We'll have another option where we can talk to Emily later.

Speaker 1 (02:32):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (02:33):
<laugh>. And then why don't we only talk when we're allowed? Does that sound like a great plan?

Speaker 3 (02:39):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>,

Speaker 2 (02:40):
We can keep on, keep focused. Yeah. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And then do y'all have any others that y'all like, that y'all would like to add to our classroom rules and norms?

Speaker 1 (02:50):
Um,

Speaker 2 (02:51):
Yeah. Jayla,

Speaker 1 (02:53):
Did we say everybody's got a focus? Did we say focus?

Speaker 2 (02:57):
Yeah, that, that's a great one. We can always get focused on the task at hand so we get through all the learning activities that we're gonna do. That's a great one. Does anybody else have one that they'd like to add? Yeah, Emily.

Speaker 1 (03:10):
Um, I think should people's not touching other people's things,

Speaker 2 (03:19):
That kinda stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Definitely. Those are great ones. Do y'all have any others? No. Okay. Well I have a few more. So why don't we always be prepared for class? Okay. So if we have a homework assignment that we're gonna do, we need to do it before we come to class so you can actively participate.

Speaker 1 (03:42):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

Speaker 2 (03:44):
Yeah. That's a great one. And then I guess a last one that we have, um, besides being kind to your neighbor and respecting their space and their opinions is just having fun. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

Speaker 1 (03:57):
Oh yeah. Can I have?

Speaker 2 (03:59):
Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Well thank y'all so much for helping

Speaker 1 (04:03):
Me, Mina. Oh, do you, um, do we have a book report due today? Is it due today or not? I dunno. Will, we're supposed to be listening now.

Speaker 2 (04:14):
Hey, will, I

Speaker 1 (04:15):
Forgot my book report? Yeah. Hey.

Speaker 2 (04:18):
Hey, will, we're focusing on our classroom norms right now. Okay. If you have a question, got your report, come talk to me later. Okay.

Speaker 1 (04:25):
No, I got a norm. Um, everybody has to come prepare.

Speaker 2 (04:30):
Yeah, that's a great one. Okay, well thank y'all so much. If y'all don't have any more, um, suggestions,

Speaker 1 (04:39):
This is boring. Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (04:44):
Because it's important to have classroom rules and norms cuz if we don't, then the classroom won't function properly. So that's why we're doing

Speaker 1 (04:52):
That's

Speaker 2 (04:52):
Good. Yeah. But we're, but if teacher, if nobody else has any other suggestions, then thank you so much for participating, creating your classroom room norms with me.

Speaker 1 (05:03):
Okay. All right.
