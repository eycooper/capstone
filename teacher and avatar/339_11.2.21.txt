Uh, so that we established at the beginning of the year. So my, our first one is to listen respectfully, to actively listen. Can anybody give me an example of actively listening?

Speaker 1 (00:34):
Uh, yeah, like, you know, facing forward and, and listening to, uh, the teacher or whoever's talking

Speaker 1 (00:46):
Can, I'm sitting up what

Speaker 2 (00:47):
You're talking about. Let's practice our active listening and, yeah. Okay. So thank you Mina. So yeah, one thing about active listening is that we have our eyes on the speaker and we have our mouse closed and we are really thinking about what the speaker is saying. And Carlos, I really like that point. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> about how you have to, like, it can go with a peer or with a teacher. Yes. Emily, do you have anything there?

Speaker 1 (01:10):

Thank you. I'm gonna call on one of you next to share another expectation, but will, yeah, I definitely like that. Being safe with our bodies, walking, not running, and yeah, just being mindful of other people's space. All right. Um, so our third expectation I wanna go over is try our hardest and do our best work. Jayla, do you have anything to share

Speaker 1 (02:40):
About that? Oh, I was gonna, I was gonna suggest, um, you know, showing up on time and just being ready to work, having your homework done, or you, or your reading done and just kind of being ready to, um, jump in.

Speaker 2 (02:53):
Yeah. Great. Jenna, thank you for sharing it. And I was gonna go over that. So yeah, that's definitely a good example of being responsible and being on top of everything. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Great. Right? So go to our next, our other expectation to try our hardest and do our best. Oh, can you give an example?

Speaker 1 (03:08):
Oh, I wanted to mention, you know, I finally got to see the first, uh, Ironman movie over the weekend and it was, it was great. Uh, I don't anyone's seen it

Speaker 2 (03:18):

Okay. Thank you.

Speaker 2 (03:22):
Okay. Alright. Emily. So an example of trying our hardest. Yeah.

Speaker 1 (03:27):
You know, I was gonna say, um, you know, be respectful of like people's things. Like, um, you know, if you, you know, I wouldn't take like Carlos's pen or he wouldn't take something that's mine without asking, you know, just be respectful of people's belongings maybe.

Speaker 2 (03:49):
Yeah. Right. That is definitely one thing we wanna focus on being respectful. I think that goes back to what Will was saying, but can you think of an example of trying your hardest and doing your best to work? How, what would that look like?

Speaker 1 (04:00):
Oh, um, oh, it's like participating and like being a part of the discussion maybe? No, yeah.

Speaker 2 (04:07):

Speaker 1 (04:36):

Speaker 2 (04:40):
