Speaker 1 (00:02):
Perfect.

Speaker 2 (00:02):
So good. Let's begin. Simulation.

Speaker 3 (00:14):
Hello class. How are we? I hope we had a great break. Um, since we are back, I did wanna remind us about our classroom expectation.

Speaker 1 (00:23):
Wait, wait, wait, wait. How was your break?

Speaker 3 (00:26):
My break was wonderful. Thank you so much for asking. Okay, so let's listen. You're welcome. Welcome. Thank you. Let's listen to our expectations. So we want to remember to be respectful to ourselves, our peers, and our teacher. And we think about what that looks like. That looks like waiting for others to stop talking. For us to talk.

Speaker 1 (00:48):
You'll sit up. I am sitting up. Pay attention.

Speaker 3 (00:52):
Let's think about that one more time. So that

Speaker 1 (00:54):
Is, I am paying attention. Hmm.

Speaker 3 (00:59):
Thank you Will. So that means listening to others and waiting for our turn to talk. And it also is not getting up from our desk while some we're doing a different activity. And we also wanna raise our hand if we need help or have a question.

Speaker 1 (01:19):
Oh,

Speaker 3 (01:22):
Emily, remember we had to turn our phones off during class?

Speaker 1 (01:26):
Oh, yes, yes. Sorry. And my mom sent me a text.

Speaker 3 (01:31):
No worries. But please put it on silence for next time.

Speaker 1 (01:35):
Got it.

Speaker 3 (01:52):
That was everyone's break. <laugh>.

Speaker 1 (01:58):
Mine was great.

Speaker 3 (01:59):
What did you do, Jayla?

Speaker 1 (02:01):
I hung out a lot with my cousins and we played some games and Oh, we went to the trampoline park.

Speaker 3 (02:14):
That sounds like so much fun. What was your favorite part of your,

Speaker 1 (02:17):
Are you coming to my birthday party at the trampoline park? Yeah, of course. I wouldn't miss it.

Speaker 3 (02:24):
Jayla, that was a great idea. Let's give the turn for Emily to talk. Emily, how was your break?

Speaker 1 (02:30):
Um, my break was good. Yeah, thanks.

Speaker 3 (02:35):
Of course. How about you Carlos? How was your break? Thank you for staying quiet and respectful. That's really nice.

Speaker 1 (02:41):
You're you're welcome. My break was, um, I was gonna say something,

Speaker 3 (02:49):
Huh? That's okay. Do you want me to get back to you?

Speaker 1 (02:53):
Yeah, yeah, that, thanks.

Speaker 3 (02:56):
Okay, of course. Let's give Mina a turn and talk. Well, well remember you're gonna be next. Mina, how was your break?

Speaker 1 (03:06):
Um, my break was fine. Thanks. I think Jayla has a question.

Speaker 3 (03:11):
Jayla? Yes. What's your question?

Speaker 1 (03:13):
Yeah, I just, I wondered if, since we're talking about, about classroom norms, it would be good for us to focus as a norm.

Speaker 3 (03:23):
Yes. That's a great, that's a great norm. Of course, we always do wanna focus in class and classroom instruction. Can you tell me what focusing looks like?

Speaker 1 (03:33):
Um, it means <laugh> not falling asleep.

Speaker 3 (03:37):
That's good. Why don't we go to Will, will. What's a good norm that you think when a full classroom is talking? We're sharing ideas and the teacher's talking. What do you think we

Speaker 1 (03:45):
Oh, I remember. I remember I, I watched, um, Ironman over break. That's what I did. Yeah, it was awesome.

Speaker 3 (03:53):
Great. Carlos, however, I wasn't going to you yet, but let's give will a turn a talk about norms and then I'll get back to you. And I would love to hear about that movie.

Speaker 1 (04:02):
Uh, will. Yes.

Speaker 3 (04:08):
Um, what did you think is a good way for all of us to focus and stay with our attention and our active listening skills?

Speaker 1 (04:16):
What do you think? I think we should be respectful of each other's spaces,

Speaker 3 (04:21):
Emily, however, will was talking. We don't wanna be disrespectful to will.

Speaker 1 (04:25):
Hi. Sorry.

Speaker 3 (04:26):
That's okay.

Speaker 1 (04:27):
Oh crap. Mina. Did, did we have a book report due today? No. Will, I don't think so. Are you sure? Yes. I would've written it down. You sure? I didn't like, forget to write it down. Positive. I never forget anything.

Speaker 3 (04:44):
And tell us the norms so that we all,

Speaker 1 (04:46):
This is boring. Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 3 (04:50):
Yes. Since it seems like some of our friends are having a little bit of a tough time trying to remember what the norms were when someone's talking, we do have to remind that one more time. However, you're doing a really good job, Jayla, whenever you're sitting respectfully.

Speaker 1 (05:03):
Thanks.

Speaker 3 (05:04):
We wanna remember to stay quiet and if we do have a question, time for talking will be right after the instructions are given. Right? So we were going over class norms and we did have a chance for everybody to share

Speaker 1 (05:18):
And simulation

Speaker 3 (05:20):
<laugh>,

Speaker 1 (05:21):
Thanks for your time.
