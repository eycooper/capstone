Speaker 1 (00:03):
Begin Nek.

Speaker 2 (00:10):
Am I just, hi. Hi guys. So welcome back to the class. How are you all doing today?

Speaker 3 (00:18):
I'm good.

Speaker 2 (00:19):
Good. Okay. So we here, I'm good. So we have Nina, will, Jayla, Emily, and Carlos. Okay. Yeah. So I'm Ms. As now, we're just gonna go over some of the class norms and some behavioral expectations before we dive into curriculum.

Speaker 3 (00:39):
Sure. Off?

Speaker 2 (00:41):
Okay. Yeah, that's a good one. Thank you, bill. Yeah, so, hey,

Speaker 3 (00:46):
Will, he has his,

Speaker 2 (00:51):
Oh yeah, so that can be definitely. Okay. So we know that we're not allowed to use cell phones in class during the school day. You guys are allowed them after school, so that should already not be a problem. So just remember that if you do have your cell phone in your book bag, have it on silent because vibrate is very distracting.

Speaker 3 (01:17):
Sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:20):
Yes.

Speaker 3 (01:22):
Sorry.

Speaker 1 (01:23):
Yes.

Speaker 2 (01:23):
Okay. What are some other class norms?

Speaker 3 (01:26):
Sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:28):
You're good, you're good. What are some other class norms you wanna establish together?

Speaker 3 (01:33):
Uh oh. Are we gonna, um, do like any kinda science fair stuff this year has, I've been working with like, um, homemade volcanoes and I just think I, I'd be kinda fun to do in class.

Speaker 2 (01:46):
Yes. That would be so fun. I definitely agree. I like doing that when I was in elementary school. Um, in my class. We don't do volcanoes since this is English, but you know, definitely in Mr. Nelson's class you'll have your time for volcanoes.

Speaker 3 (02:02):
All right. Yeah.

Speaker 2 (02:06):
What are some other classes?

Speaker 3 (02:08):
You turn your cell phone off. You do you guys have cell phone? What do you, Hey, don't start with me. Come on. That's starting, finishing.

Speaker 2 (02:25):
Is there, hi. Is there something going on that you guys wanna guess

Speaker 3 (02:28):
Will being well good. Mean being, yeah, <laugh>. That was funny

Speaker 2 (02:35):
Actually. Do you guys need me to change your seats?

Speaker 3 (02:39):
Uh, I'll be quiet. Sorry. You're good. You'll be quiet.

Speaker 2 (02:44):
This behavior is actually something that can help shape our conversation about class norms. So what, what would you guys do if someone in the classroom was bothering you?

Speaker 3 (03:01):
That's a good question. Uh oh. So what was I gonna say? Like, are we gonna do like, so will the science fair this year be like competitive or is it just gonna be this class? Do you know anything about that?

Speaker 2 (03:16):
I don't know

Speaker 3 (03:17):
Anything about that. I love science. I, I dunno if you could have guessed that by

Speaker 2 (03:20):
Now. I love it. I love it. I love science too. It's a great topic. Um, I think there might be a competitive element to it, but you'll have to double check with your

Speaker 3 (03:30):
Science. Super competitive is why,

Speaker 2 (03:32):
So yeah, that's good. And it's good to have a competitive spirit, but definitely in our classroom we wanna make sure everyone feels welcomed and cared for. So I want you to know that you're all very smart, brilliant students and individuals. So I want, even though I want you guys to get good grades, I want you guys, this

Speaker 3 (03:51):
Is boring. Why are we doing this? Sorry. That's okay.

Speaker 2 (03:55):
That's okay. It's okay that this is boring. We just have to get through the boring stuff in order to get to the fun stuff. So once you guys share with me what you want to do as like a class norm, like what type of behavior you guys expect, then we can maybe

Speaker 3 (04:09):
Like showing up on time. That might be good.

Speaker 2 (04:11):
Showing up on time. Yes. Being punctual. I like that. That's showing respect to me. And as well as your peers. What are some other ones?

Speaker 3 (04:21):
Uh, will you wanna participate be for the first time? Why don't you participate instead of bugging me? Well, it's too easy. You're too easy at target. What? Oh, do you hear this? I'm being abused. You're, you're abusive. You're abuse. Okay,

Speaker 2 (04:41):
We'll end mi Yeah. I need you guys to stop whatever conversation you're having. Hi. Okay, let's take a, let's take a breath and I want you guys to apologize to each other.

Speaker 3 (04:53):
Sorry. Well, sorry. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 2 (04:58):
Are you guys gonna be able to get through this class

Speaker 3 (05:01):
Separate? Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Issue we're working through.

Speaker 2 (05:06):
Okay, good, good. Well that's definitely something you guys can work on are

Speaker 3 (05:10):
In simulation.
