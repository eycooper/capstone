Speaker 1 (00:02):
And start simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:06):
Hello class.

Speaker 1 (00:08):
Hi there.

Speaker 2 (00:08):
Today we're gonna talk about our classroom norms that we made at the beginning of the year and go back through just to review them. Okay? So do you guys remember our first norm that we came up with together was we said that we wanted to always come to class ready to learn. Can anyone tell me what that means?

Speaker 1 (00:29):
Um, be prepared.

Speaker 2 (00:31):
Great. What would it look like to be prepared for class?

Speaker 1 (00:36):
Well, answering. I don't, I don't see

Speaker 2 (00:41):
Nina. It's okay if Will doesn't answer Nina. It's okay if Will doesn't know the answer.

Speaker 1 (00:46):
Okay. I'm just trying to encourage him.

Speaker 2 (00:48):
Thank you.

Speaker 1 (00:49):
Sure, sure. No

Speaker 2 (00:50):
Problem. Does anybody else have an answer? For what? Like, to be prepared.

Speaker 1 (00:56):
Um, I think maybe it needs, uh, like, you know, having your homework done and like, being ready to contribute.

Speaker 2 (01:04):
That's a great example, Carlos. Thank you. All right. Our next norm that we came up with is we said that we wanted to always listen when someone else is talking. Why did we say this was an important norm?

Speaker 1 (01:17):
I'm getting it. Text. Sorry. Um, paying attention keeps everything kinda moving.

Speaker 2 (01:26):
Great. Emily, do you remember? Yes. What our other norm was about using technology in the classroom?

Speaker 1 (01:32):
Um, no, I'm sorry. I get these tweet notifications. All the impeachment stuff.

Speaker 2 (01:40):
There's a lot going on in the news right now. Can somebody remind Emily what we

Speaker 1 (01:44):
Made? Oh. Oh, speaking of which I wanted to see. Um, so what's, uh, your policy on like, like, um, if I wanted to have like a, like a rocket club or something like that? Great.

Speaker 2 (01:55):
You wanna have a rocket club in the classroom?

Speaker 1 (01:57):
Well, not, I mean, I guess I, I just was wondering how like, extracurriculars work and if we could like, use the room and stuff like

Speaker 2 (02:05):
That. Great. That's a great question, Carlos. Can we talk about that once we finish reviewing our classroom norms?

Speaker 1 (02:11):
Answer will, well should push me around.

Speaker 2 (02:17):
All right. Will and Mina. If somebody has an answer, they can choose to share. Okay. We don't have to tell each other what to share. Remember our next best talks about our next norm is we said that we wanted to respect our classmates. Do you guys remember what the word respect means?

Speaker 1 (02:35):
Yes.

Speaker 2 (02:36):
What does it mean Jayla?

Speaker 1 (02:38):
Um, listening. Like when other people talk, um, you know, respecting opinions. No, not touching people's stuff. Just being respectful. Great.

Speaker 2 (02:50):
Come around. Great. Those are all great examples. So when we do that, we'll make everyone feel welcome and a part of our class, right? Yeah.

Speaker 1 (02:57):
Yeah.

Speaker 2 (02:58):
All right. So we, we had one more norm that we came up with. So we remember we said, not that we were going to use materials the way they're supposed to be used.

Speaker 1 (03:06):
Oh. Oh, when is the science fair? Cause like, I learned how to make this like a volcano, uh, with was it bacon, soda and like, uh, other stuff. That sounds really cool. How idea is, is my point.

Speaker 2 (03:20):
Exactly. Those are great ideas and we'll get to them as soon as we finish going through our norms. Okay? Ok. Cause remember we just talked about wanting to listen to each other and respect each other. Okay. So once we finish, we'll talk about the science fair. All right, so our last norm, we talked about using the materials the way they should be used. Can anybody give an example of what that looks like? Will, do you have any ideas? Oh, Emily.

Speaker 1 (03:45):
Well, um, maybe I, I dunno. This is boring. Why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (03:55):
That's a great question, Jayla. Yeah. Why are our classroom norms important? Just curious. Do you remember?

Speaker 1 (04:01):
Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2 (04:02):
<affirmative>, why is it important for us to have norms?

Speaker 1 (04:05):
Um, well, I guess like, so we're not all running around crazy.

Speaker 2 (04:11):
Great. Yeah, that's a great reason. So I like of

Speaker 1 (04:14):
A better.

Speaker 2 (04:15):
Yeah. So our last one we talked about using materials the way it should be. An example. I can give you one. I know you

Speaker 1 (04:21):
Shouldn't tell me what to do anymore. Well, you should participate more,

Speaker 2 (04:27):
More Will andina.

Speaker 1 (04:29):
Well, yeah, sorry. Yeah, yeah. All right. Sorry. Just opening up some, some old wounds over here.

Speaker 2 (04:38):
Let's talk about that in a few minutes. Okay?

Speaker 1 (04:41):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (04:42):
All right. So when we wanna use our materials the way they should be, a good example of that, remember, is we can use our computers when we're doing math games, but when we're not doing math games, we don't wanna be on the computers. Right? Okay, great. All right. So that was all of our classroom norms. Cool. So we wanna remember that we keep following these so we can respect each other and have a good learning environment, kind of like Jayla was saying earlier. Um, and, and.
