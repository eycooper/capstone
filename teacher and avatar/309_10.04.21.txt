Speaker 1 (00:00):
Begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:04):
Hi class. How are you?

Speaker 1 (00:07):
Hi, teacher.

Speaker 2 (00:09):
All right. Today I wanna talk about a couple norms with you all that we wanna set, um, as we continue the school year. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So the first thing I wanted to talk about is being respectful. Who can tell me what it means to be respectful?

Speaker 1 (00:27):
Um, that means that like you let other people talk and you don't interrupt.

Speaker 2 (00:32):
Okay. That's a good aspect of it. Thanks Carlos. Yeah. I would say being respectful, um, means caring about other people. Um, and being

Speaker 1 (00:44):
Sit up. You need to sit up.

Speaker 2 (00:46):
Nina, can I have your eyes and ears up?

Speaker 1 (00:49):
You need to pay attention.

Speaker 2 (00:52):
Thank you. Yes ma'am. Yeah. And so this goes right into being respectful. A part of being respectful is listening to other people who are talking. So sometimes it'll be the teacher and sometimes it'll be your classmates. So we need to make sure, um, as a part of that also we've raised our hand when we wanna talk. So for the rest of this conversation we can practice that too. Um, and going off of that, I thought another thing that would be cool for us to do is being, um, a

Speaker 1 (01:19):
Text. Oh, I got a

Speaker 2 (01:21):
Text. Not a good time.

Speaker 1 (01:23):
My mom sending. Not a

Speaker 2 (01:24):
Good time, Emily. So another thing we wanna do is make sure we're engaged in the lesson and what the teachers talk about or what your classmates are sharing. Um, and so part of that is just listening, um, to what's going on and thinking through things and redirecting your attention when you get distracted because we all get distracted. So we need to

Speaker 1 (01:47):
Redirect. I'm so tired.

Speaker 2 (01:50):
I know. Will me too. I can

Speaker 1 (01:52):
Last night.

Speaker 2 (01:54):
I know that happens to me too, but this is a good example of a distraction and we can remind ourselves in on the inside to redirect our attention. And we don't have to say it out loud. I like the nods. That's a good way to participate. Another thing we can do, another norm we can set is, Emily, are you

Speaker 1 (02:11):
Going to jump today after school?

Speaker 2 (02:13):
Hey Jayla. Not a good time.

Speaker 1 (02:15):
Hello? Are you gonna hang on. I'm birthday Emily.

Speaker 2 (02:18):
Jayla not a good time. Let's focus on our classroom norms. Okay. Thank

Speaker 1 (02:23):
You. Okay, sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:25):
Another thing we can do is be open-minded. Who can tell me what it means to be open-minded. I can help you all out. That kind

Speaker 1 (02:34):
Of just, uh, well, I know, I know. Teacher. Um, okay, go ahead. Like, um, open-minded means like, you, you like to hear other, other stuff, other ideas.

Speaker 2 (02:46):
Awesome. That's exactly what I would say. Yeah. It just means opening your mind to new ideas. Other people may think differently than you, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily wrong. So I think it's a great idea for us to be open minded to what other people have to say. Yes, Jayla.

Speaker 1 (03:01):
Yeah. I think that should be one of our norms. Like be open-minded.

Speaker 2 (03:06):
I agree. Yeah, let's definitely have that one. No,

Speaker 1 (03:08):
But um, I just saw the Ironman movies, um,

Speaker 2 (03:13):
Carlos,

Speaker 1 (03:13):
Those, I mean, that's really cool and they're kind of open-minded in those <laugh>. It's kinda funny. Yeah. But did anyone see the Ironman? Ah,

Speaker 2 (03:23):
Okay. That's a good connection. We can talk about if your friends have seen the Ironman later, but I do like that you connected something in your everyday life to our classroom norms. That's very cool. Does anyone else have any norms that they would want to add to the list?

Speaker 1 (03:38):
Yeah,

Speaker 2 (03:39):
Go ahead Emily.

Speaker 1 (03:41):
Um, I think, um, what of the norms should be that the, um, everyone in the classroom is respectable and respectful of people's space.

Speaker 2 (03:51):
Yeah.

Speaker 1 (03:52):
Not running, not touching other people's things, except

Speaker 2 (03:56):
That's awesome. Yeah. It's very important to be respectful because everyone comes to, but some people feel more sensitive to people being in their bubble or touching their stuff than other people. So it's always a good idea to give people their space. Um, and to ask if you need to borrow someone's ask.

Speaker 1 (04:16):
Are you, did you do the yet? Um, is it due today or not? Well, I might have missed something.

Speaker 2 (04:25):
Well, yeah,

Speaker 1 (04:26):
Yeah.

Speaker 2 (04:27):
Isaac, yours. Thank you.

Speaker 1 (04:29):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (04:30):
All right. Any other norms that we wanna add to the list? I have one more I'd like to share. I think it's a good practice to be responsible too, which basically means on task,

Speaker 1 (04:44):
This is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (04:48):
We're doing it so we know how to be good classmates to ourselves and to others. We wanna make sure that we're here at school ready to learn and we're respected. Um, and yeah.

Speaker 1 (05:00):
Okay. All right. And simulation. Uh, thank you for.
