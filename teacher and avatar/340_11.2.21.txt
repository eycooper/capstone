Okay. So our first, um, class norm is that we are going to be respectful. Nice. So that means being respectful

Speaker 1 (00:35):
Of

Speaker 2 (00:36):
The teacher, of others and yourself. Nina, can you come up with an example of what it means to be respectful to other people?

Speaker 1 (00:47):
Yes. Um, I think when everyone like listens and someone's talking. So listen to the person that's

Speaker 2 (00:54):
Talking. Exactly. If you're listening while someone's talking. Does that mean that you're chatting with your friend?

Speaker 1 (01:00):

Speaker 2 (01:24):

Speaker 2 (03:23):
So, really? Okay. I had, but I do wanna ask you more about it after this conversation. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 1 (03:30):
Out. Cool. Sounds

Speaker 2 (03:31):
Good. Yeah, I'll ask you. Cool. Um, does anybody else have another class norm that we haven't talked about that you wanna add to the list? Emily?

Speaker 1 (03:41):
Um, maybe like, Hmm. Well, you said the thing about throwing pencils. I was gonna say like, no running, um, like don't touch things that aren't yours unless you ask, or, or whatever. So just be like, respectful of space and other people's space too. Uhhuh.

Speaker 2 (04:02):

Speaker 1 (04:26):
Um,

Speaker 2 (04:26):

Speaker 2 (04:33):
Okay. Yeah, yeah. Awesome.

Speaker 1 (04:37):
This

Speaker 2 (04:37):
Is,

Speaker 1 (04:38):
This is boring. Why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (04:42):
Did you already know all the, all the norms? You didn't forget them?

Speaker 1 (04:45):
Oh, no, I was just, I was just curious why we were doing it. That's all. Okay.

Speaker 2 (04:49):
Well, the reason why I'm doing this is you might already know then. I'm sure you do, but I wanna do this so I can set my expectations so you guys know exactly what is expected. And then if I tell you something like, Hey, remember we were gonna be respectful to the teacher or something, then there we go.
