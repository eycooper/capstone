Speaker 1 (00:02):
And start simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:10):
Okay. Hey guys. Um,

Speaker 3 (00:12):
Hey teacher.

Speaker 2 (00:12):
How are you guys doing today?

Speaker 3 (00:15):
Good.

Speaker 2 (00:16):
Good. So today we are going to review, um, some of our behavioral expectations in our classroom. Who can tell me one of the expectations that we have in class? Jayla, do you have any ideas?

Speaker 3 (00:32):
But, um, well, I can your science if you just listen. I don't need your help. So,

Speaker 2 (00:39):
Hey, Nina and Will. Sure. Do you have any ideas of behavioral expectations for the class?

Speaker 3 (00:47):
Um, no talking when the teacher's talking.

Speaker 2 (00:51):
That's a great expectation. Why don't we talk when the teacher's talking?

Speaker 3 (00:57):
Because then everybody can't hear people get interrupted and stuff.

Speaker 2 (01:01):
Right? Should you be talking when your peers are sharing? No. No. Right? Because everybody should feel that their voice can be heard, right?

Speaker 3 (01:10):
Oh,

Speaker 1 (01:11):
Huh.

Speaker 3 (01:12):
I had a text. No.

Speaker 2 (01:14):
Okay. Emily, what's another rule that we could use in our classroom?

Speaker 3 (01:19):
Sorry, I just got a text from my mom.

Speaker 2 (01:22):
Okay. Would you mind putting your phone away please?

Speaker 3 (01:24):
Sure. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:25):
Thank you.

Speaker 3 (01:27):
Um,

Speaker 1 (01:29):
Um,

Speaker 3 (01:29):
People should come to class prepared,

Speaker 2 (01:32):
Come to pla class prepared. What do we need to be prepared in

Speaker 3 (01:34):
Class? Well, I can tell you all about that. I mean, I come to class prepared every day and, um, I know all the norms for what we're gonna do this year. I can give you a whole list of 'em. Do you want me to go over 'em with you?

Speaker 2 (01:45):
Carlos? What are three things that you need to bring to class every day to be prepared?

Speaker 3 (01:50):
Um, yourself. Okay. Your notebook, homework and your planner.

Speaker 2 (01:56):
Those are great things. Do you need to have a positive attitude when you come to class?

Speaker 3 (02:01):
Yes, ma'am.

Speaker 2 (02:02):
Right. Because learning is fun and sometimes it's hard, but if we have positive attitude, we can get through it, right? All together, right? Jayla, do you have any new ideas of what Another behavioral expectation

Speaker 3 (02:14):
Classroom? Shut up. Mina. I'm not what you want me to

Speaker 2 (02:18):
Do. Will Mina please focus your eyes on me? Will eyes on you please. Thank you. Jayla, do you have any ideas?

Speaker 3 (02:26):
Um, for a classroom? No.

Speaker 2 (02:28):
Yes. Behavioral expectations?

Speaker 3 (02:30):
Um, everybody's gotta be kind.

Speaker 2 (02:35):
Everybody should be kind. What are the, should we be kind to each other?

Speaker 3 (02:39):
Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. What

Speaker 2 (02:40):
About to ourselves

Speaker 3 (02:41):
Meant? Yeah. Oh,

Speaker 2 (02:44):
And what about to the things in our classroom? Should we be kind to our materials and take care of our things?

Speaker 3 (02:49):
Yeah. Don't write on the desks. Don't put gum under the desk. Somebody always puts gum under the

Speaker 2 (02:54):
Desk, right? Don't put your gum under the desk. Don't write on the desks. Take care of of your books. Don't draw on them. Right? Make sure we put things back where they belong so that we can use them for the whole year. Can

Speaker 3 (03:05):
We talk about my science fair project Now? Um, teacher, I wanna run my, uh, topic by you and make sure that it's okay so I can get started. Recess.

Speaker 2 (03:14):
Yeah. Carlos, I'd love to talk with you about that right before recess. Can talk one on one, okay?

Speaker 3 (03:19):
What?

Speaker 2 (03:20):
We can talk. Just me and you. Okay. Would that be good? Well, in a couple minutes once we go to recess, okay. Okay. Okay. Awesome. Mina, do you have anything else to add? Any other behavioral expectations? What is it?

Speaker 3 (03:37):
Raise?

Speaker 2 (03:38):
Talk. Talk. You should raise your hand before you talk. Why is that?

Speaker 3 (03:42):
Everybody gets a turn.

Speaker 2 (03:44):
Does everybody gets a turn? Right? So kind of like going back to what Will was saying about not talking over other people, right? Not talking when somebody

Speaker 3 (03:52):
Else is talking. This is boring. Why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (03:55):
So, Jayla, we have to review our behavioral expectations because lately we haven't been listening in class and following the rules that we said at the beginning of the year. So right now we're gonna review them so that way we can move forward as a responsible, respectful classroom.

Speaker 3 (04:09):
Okie dokey

Speaker 2 (04:10):
Teacher, do you agree with that?

Speaker 3 (04:13):
Yes, ma'am.

Speaker 2 (04:13):
Awesome. Does anyone have anything else to add about expectations that we have in our classroom trip?

Speaker 3 (04:22):
Okay, if

Speaker 2 (04:22):
You, that's okay. Hey Nina. Hey Nina.

I worked on my science fair project.

Speaker 2 (04:42):
You did awesome. Will, what did you do this weekend?

Speaker 3 (04:45):
LL Collection. Oh, very cool. And I'm classifying on board and, um, about all the effects of the

Speaker 2 (04:58):
I'm very excited to see that when you bring it in. That will be very cool. Thanks. Will, what did you do this weekend?

Dad. What kind of game was it?
