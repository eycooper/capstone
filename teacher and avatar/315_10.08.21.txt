Speaker 1 (00:13):
Hey Kate. How are you?

Speaker 2 (00:15):
I'm doing well. Cool. Um, so let's get started and review some norms. I know many of you are excited. Um, we just came from back for vacation. Um, yeah. So let's talk about respect and listening, uh, to each other and listening to me. Um mm-hmm. <affirmative>, what does that mean to each of you?

Speaker 1 (00:36):
Snap. I'm sitting up. What do not paying attention. Oh, I'm sorry. Paying a, I'm sorry. Sorry. All right.

Speaker 2 (00:54):
Nina, do you have, um, something you wanna say? Oh,

Speaker 1 (00:57):

Speaker 2 (01:30):
Perfect. What about, um, you Jayla, what does respect mean to you?

Speaker 1 (01:35):
Um, um, I think means, uh, paying attention, uh, when someone's talking maybe?

Speaker 2 (01:43):
Yeah. Well, are you feeling a little tired?

Speaker 1 (01:50):
Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, sorry. I stayed up too late last night. I was watching, it was on YouTube Regional. Sorry. Right honor.

Speaker 2 (02:15):

Speaker 1 (02:17):
Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:19):
No, that's fine. Um, I get that, um, everyone's excited to see each other again. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But, um, let's also talk about, um, hand raising. Cuz many of you, like, it's been a while since it's been in the classroom, but just remember if you have an idea you wanna share to raise your hand and then, you know, Jayla, you have a question. Oh,

Speaker 1 (02:42):
Yeah. I was just thinking for a, um, a good norm would be, uh, she got on time and, uh, yeah. Yeah. Just kind of being ready to go, you know, at the beginning of class, stuff like that.

Speaker 2 (02:56):
Yeah. That's a good norm. Hmm. Have another norm.

Speaker 1 (03:01):
Um, oh, oh, I just wanted to say I saw, finally saw Iron Man, uh, this weekend. I knew him like 10 years late, but it was so awesome. So awesome. Awesome.

Speaker 2 (03:16):
Okay.

Speaker 1 (03:17):
Really cool. I love those Marvel movies, so I'm just kinda getting hooked as you can say. Yeah. <laugh>. So,

Speaker 2 (03:27):
Okay. Does anyone have another norm they wanna address?

Speaker 1 (03:33):
Um,

Speaker 2 (03:35):
Yeah, Emily.

Speaker 1 (03:37):
Yeah. Um, I think it's good to be respectful, uh, people's space and, uh, you know, maybe not to run or touch other people's things. You know, just kinda give people, um, space.

Speaker 2 (03:57):
Yeah. No, that's excellent, excellent point. Yeah. It's important that we're mindful of each other's space and we don't intrude on another person's face.

Speaker 1 (04:06):
Oh, yeah. Oh, oh. Um, Mina, did we have anything due today? No, please. Came back from vacation.

Speaker 2 (04:16):
Will I, Mina?

Speaker 1 (04:17):
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just worried about I, for some reason I thought something was due today, but, but it's the first day back from vacation, right? Yeah's fine.

Speaker 2 (04:26):
Yes. But it's important. It's important and we're respectful. Okay. So you can talk about, about that during break

Speaker 1 (04:32):
Or Gotcha.

Speaker 2 (04:34):
Okay.

Speaker 1 (04:35):
This is, um, boring. Well, why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (04:39):
Well, Jayla um, we're covering this because it's been a while since we've been in the classroom and it's important to watch on these topics once again.

Speaker 1 (04:48):
Okay. Okay. Just checking. Sorry. That's

Speaker 2 (04:51):
Fine.

Speaker 1 (04:54):
