Speaker 1 (00:05):
And start simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:08):
Hi class. How are you guys doing today?

Speaker 1 (00:11):
Hey, good, how are you?

Speaker 2 (00:12):
I'm good, thank you. We're gonna talk about, um, some behavior expectations for our classroom today. Um, does anyone have one off the top of their head that we should include in our expectations for class?

Speaker 1 (00:29):
Um, maybe, uh, you know, show up on time and like, be ready to work.

Speaker 2 (00:36):
Yeah. Thank you. Well, that's a great one. Um, does everyone agree with that? Does anyone else have something to add?

Speaker 1 (00:42):
Well, where's my drink? What do you do with it? I didn't do anything with it. Know, I was just, just,

Speaker 2 (00:48):
Hey, will and Nina, let's stand. My drink

Speaker 1 (00:50):
Is

Speaker 2 (00:50):
Missing on task, so, um, will,

Speaker 1 (00:54):
We'll take my drink

Speaker 2 (00:55):
Coming ready? Jayla, do you have any behavior expectations? Um, from

Speaker 1 (01:00):
Classroom? We'll, we'll put my, my drink. I didn't take your drink.

Speaker 2 (01:06):
Okay, so I'm not sure what happened, but we could use this as an opportunity to talk about an expectation of maybe respecting other people's things. Um, that could be an expectation. Emily, what do you think about that one? Um,

Speaker 1 (01:19):
Sorry, my mom just texted me and don't know why. Okay. Putting the phone

Speaker 2 (01:28):
Away. Yeah. Thank you Emily. Um, we're gonna keep our phones away in class. Maybe that's another expectation when we come ready for class. Like Will said, that means that we put our away.

Speaker 1 (01:38):
So I had a quick thing I wanted to mention. So I, I had a, um, I spent some time writing a screenplay about a, a superhero. I, and I was thinking maybe we could do a read through of it. Um, if anyone's up for it.

Speaker 2 (01:51):
Um, Carlos, that sounds like a really cool idea, but that's not what we're talking about right now. So we can talk about that later. But right now we're talking about behavior expectations for our class. So first we have coming ready to class, which means putting our phones away. Um, and we also talked about respecting seal each other. Yeah. Not taking each other's things. So that would fall under the category of respect each

Speaker 1 (02:17):
Other. Take agan. Drink Thief on not drink. Thief. Sh

Speaker 2 (02:23):
Nina. And Will, let's keep talking about behavior expectations. Um, what about using indoor voices in the classroom? Do you guys think that would be a good one to include?

Speaker 1 (02:32):
Yeah, definitely.

Speaker 2 (02:34):
Why? Why might we wanna use our indoor voices in the classroom?

Speaker 1 (02:38):
Um, well I think that, uh, it helps us out. Okay, man. Be under control, listen to each other,

Speaker 2 (02:47):
Stuff like that. Definitely. Thank you, Jayla. That's great. Um, so another behavior expectation would be using our indoor voices. So thank you guys for being, doing a good job and listening to what, what Jayla said. That could be another expectation that we should always remember to be quiet when other people are speaking in class. Definitely. Um, Carlos, why do you think we would wanna

Speaker 1 (03:09):
Do that? What about, um, are we having a science fair this year? Cause I heard we're gonna have a science fair and I have some great idea. Yes. So

Speaker 2 (03:16):
That's awesome. But again, we are going to stay on task with what we're doing right now, talking about behavior ex ations. So Carlos,

Speaker 1 (03:24):
I said I'm psych about the science, just listening.

Speaker 2 (03:27):
That's awesome. Okay, well, what, why might we wanna listen to each other when everyone else, when someone else is speaking? Carlos?

Speaker 1 (03:38):
I'm just gonna,

Speaker 2 (03:38):
Or Emily? Yes, Emily, go ahead.

Speaker 1 (03:39):
Yeah. Um, well we all will get to listen to each other and it's pretty, I don't know, it's always better in a conversation if we're listening instead of just talking over.

Speaker 2 (03:53):
Yeah,

Speaker 1 (03:53):
Definitely. Yeah. Well, wait a minute, this is boring. Why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (03:57):
So we're talking about behavior expectations because it's a great way for us all to be on the same page about how to act in class so that our class will run smoothly and that everyone will be respectful of each other and our time and our classroom tools. Um, so that's, that's why we're doing this. Jayla.

Speaker 1 (04:16):
Okay. Yeah. I just lost my place, so.

Speaker 2 (04:18):
Nope, that's okay. Does anyone else have another behavior expectation? Um,

Speaker 1 (04:22):
My expectation is, is, uh, will doesn't steal things. It's from Yeah, my expectation is you don't lie about me stealing things. Well, my expectation is you, Nina,

Speaker 2 (04:35):
And don't lie Isaac up here, please. Okay, thank you.

Speaker 1 (04:39):
Oh,

Speaker 2 (04:40):
So we've come up with some awesome behavior expectations for our class. We talked about listening when each other, when, when another person is speaking. We talked about using our indoor voices, um, uh, respecting each other and showing up on time for class. I think that this is an awesome list, um, of behavior expectations. So if we all make an effort to follow them, I think that our school year will, um, be that much better. Does that sound like a good plan to, to

Speaker 1 (05:09):
You guys? Yeah. Sounds good.

Speaker 2 (05:10):
Great. So did anyone do anything fun over the weekend that they wanna share

Speaker 1 (05:17):
And simulation.
