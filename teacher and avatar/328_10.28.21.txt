Speaker 1 (00:01):
Begin simulation. Hi, teacher.

Speaker 2 (00:07):
Hi. How y'all doing?

Speaker 1 (00:09):
Good.

Speaker 2 (00:11):
It's a great day. So, uh, welcome. So today we're actually gonna go, we're gonna go over a couple of norms and expectations I expect from all yous in class. Uh, and I think the number one, first thing that we need to cross close the pay attention in here is be respectful of each other. If someone's talking over, if someone's talking, I'm giving you an answer, don't interrupt this person. If someone's working on something, don't interrupt that person who is working. Okay. That brings to another part, is like, make sure y'all pay attention, okay? Cause I definitely want you all to succeed and I want you to progress nicely and learn. We're gonna make this a nice, enjoyable environment. Okay? Well

Speaker 1 (00:50):
Understand. You need to pay attention. I'm paying attention, Nina. Yeah, but you need to sit straight. I quiet.

Speaker 2 (01:03):
It's okay. I understand what you're doing, but it's good. All right. But it's mind. Be mindful here. We're gonna respect each other here. All right? So, mm-hmm. <affirmative>, one thing here is if there there are any issues, don't be afraid to speak up. Okay? I want, I want y'all,

Speaker 1 (01:23):
I got text from my mom. Why is she texting me again?

Speaker 2 (01:31):
You doing okay?

Speaker 1 (01:33):
Yeah. I just got a text from my mom, so I wonder if I forgot something at home.

Speaker 2 (01:39):
Okay. Just

Speaker 1 (01:39):
Checking in. Just checking my text.

Speaker 2 (01:43):
Okay. Uh, Emily, we're currently in classroom right now, so if it's something that can be done later time, I appreciate it. You can put up your phone,

Speaker 1 (01:49):
Please. Okay. Okay, teacher.

Speaker 2 (01:51):
Thank you. Okay. Appreciate it.

Speaker 1 (01:53):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

Speaker 2 (01:54):
All right. So, alright.

Speaker 1 (01:59):
Are you tired?

Speaker 2 (02:00):
Yeah, I, I know, I know will a long thing, but you know, just power through, we'll get, we'll do just fine. Okay?

Speaker 1 (02:09):
Okay. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2 (02:11):
<affirmative>. Okay. Good, good. All. And

Speaker 1 (02:15):
Emily, are you going jump after school? Emily,

Speaker 2 (02:20):
Jayla, I

Speaker 1 (02:21):
Dunno. Jayla, I dunno. Mom,

Speaker 2 (02:25):
I'm little's. Just pay.

Speaker 1 (02:28):
Yes. Teacher. Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2 (02:29):
<affirmative>. Thank you. I great. Appreciate it. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So, uh, and another important thing that I need to focus on is there are no wrong answers. If I call on y'all to give a question, if I ask a question, call on somebody can answer this question, Jayla.

Speaker 1 (02:44):
Yeah. I think one of our norms should be like, everybody's got a focus.

Speaker 2 (02:49):
Yes. That's exactly what I'm yes. For bringing that up. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, that's actually correct. That's actually the something, second thing that I brought up. It's important to pay attention. Okay. So thank you for paying attention. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Uh, but let me finish the thought, uh, that we all, there are no wrong answers, so if you feel like you know the answer, feel free to speak up, raise your hand, speak up, and I will.

Speaker 1 (03:10):
Have you seen the Ironman movies? I saw those this summer. They were so cool. You guys. Have you seen any of the Marvel movies? Oh gosh. Oh man. Yes. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Uh,

Speaker 2 (03:23):
Yeah, I do love Ironman, but you know, we can talk about that at later time. Okay.

Speaker 1 (03:27):
Okay. Okay, great.

Speaker 2 (03:29):
But as I said before, there are no wrong answers here. Okay. Just, you know, uh, just speak up and then we will see, uh, how we can, if it's correct or if it's not, then we can guide along. So what's the correct answer, Emily?

Speaker 1 (03:43):
Um, yeah, I think that, um, one of our norms should be like, people should be respectful of other people's face. Like not running or touching other people's things.

Speaker 2 (03:53):
Yes, that's correct. Make sure you make sure you don't invade other people's personal spaces. Every person has their own, uh, space that they like to stay with or from, from afar. Some people like to be close to other people, some not so much. So it's important

Speaker 1 (04:10):
Book report today. Well, I'm not sure

Speaker 2 (04:19):
Right now, so, so, you know, we can talk after

Speaker 1 (04:21):
Work. Sure, sure. Yeah. Is that ok?

Speaker 2 (04:23):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah, it's not a problem. It's ok. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So, as I was saying, as I was saying, it's uh, make sure, don't just invade other people's spaces. Just make sure, uh, ask if it is okay to actually come a little bit closer or not, but if they're not okay with it, make sure you respect whatever they,

Speaker 1 (04:41):
Ah, this is boring. This is boring. Why are we doing this again,

Speaker 2 (04:46):
We're doing this because we, I want you all to succeed in class and this perhaps you provide, be more comfortable in the classroom because Oh. At being comfortable in the classroom that you are more willing to learn. Okay. I want this to be, I want this place to be just like home. You know? You'd be comfortable home as a Australian

Speaker 1 (05:02):
Statue. Cool. Okay. That'd be nice.

Speaker 2 (05:05):
Yeah. Plus you'll be hanging out with your friends

Speaker 3 (05:07):
End simulation. Thank you for your time completing that simulation. I hope you have a one.
