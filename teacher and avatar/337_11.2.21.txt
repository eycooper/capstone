Speaker 1 (00:00):
To start. So we will, uh, begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:07):
Hi everyone. Welcome back. Hope everyone had a great today.

Speaker 3 (00:12):
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's

Speaker 2 (00:14):
Be good. All right. So let's quickly go over some of our norms that we used before we, or before we had our vacation. Remember. So, when we come into the classroom, when we unpack, we wanna go straight to our cubies to put away our backpacks, and then we wanna wash our hands and unstack our chairs and eat our breakfast before morning announcements. Right?

Speaker 3 (00:36):
Hi. Well sit up. I'm sitting up you talking? Yep. Not paying attention.

Speaker 2 (00:43):
All right. Nina. Paying, paying attention. Let's worry about ourselves. All right. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 3 (00:48):
Okay. Check.

Speaker 2 (00:50):
And for morning meeting, remember, um, I would like if everyone could move their chairs silently to the circle and just sit there, wait for everyone to get into our morning meeting circle, and then we'll begin. All right. So what it looks like and sounds like it should be silent in our chairs. Okay. Oh, dear.

Speaker 3 (01:12):
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My mom is, my mom is texting me. Sorry. <laugh>, she's, I think I forgot something at home. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:21):
All right, Emily, let's turn off our phones and put it away in our backpack's. Okay. We don't read it at

Speaker 3 (01:26):
Our desks. I just did. Gotcha. Sorry. Gotcha.

Speaker 2 (01:30):
Okay. And when we, after morning meeting, when we get into our language arts and content writing, right. For independent work. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, remember, we want to do our best to ignore distractions and prevent distractions. Well, what else do we need to do?

Speaker 3 (01:47):
Yeah. Oh, oh, yeah. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I, I, I <laugh>, I think I stayed up too late last night. I'm sorry. What was the, what was the, what were you saying? I'm

Speaker 2 (01:57):
Sorry. So, when we're working independently, besides ignoring and preventing distractions, what else do we need to do? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>,

Speaker 3 (02:04):
Um, focus on our, on our work, I guess.

Speaker 2 (02:07):
Yes. We want to try our best and work independently on our own work. All right. Jayla, you could also give us an example of what it's, what we're supposed to do during your independent work.

Speaker 3 (02:26):
Um, well, I think you said focus on your work, but also, um, if you have any questions, uh, to ask, you know, if you, if you're not understanding something

Speaker 2 (02:36):
Exactly. So we wanna silently raise our hands so that signals to the, uh, to me that you need help and I'll come over to you as soon as I can. Right. And then number s we use our, um, index finger and our middle finger to cross them. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, so that signals that you need to use a bathroom. All right. Okay. Carlos, do you want to add anything Yes. To independent work looks like in South

Speaker 3 (03:05):
Wales? Well, you know, I was just gonna say, um, you know, over the weekend I finally got to see the first Ironman in movies, and I thought it was Ironman movie rather. And it was really cool. That's all. I just wanted a, uh, I don't know if anyone's a fan. I'm not much of a fan, but, uh, I'm looked, so it's pretty cool.

Speaker 2 (03:23):
Thank you for sharing. But let's hold that off until morning meetings share. Okay.

Speaker 3 (03:28):
Okay. Okay. Sure, sure, sure.

Speaker 2 (03:32):
All right, Tina, how about you? Would you like to add anything? Oh, yes. Emily, was that a signal from the bathroom? Yes. All right.

Speaker 3 (03:40):
Oh, no, no, no, no. I was just, just gonna add a, um, a norm. Um, I was gonna say that, you know, being respectful of people's space is good and like Yes. Maybe not running, or, um, you know, being disrespectful of other people in their space, so,

Speaker 2 (03:58):
Yep. Exactly. We want to respect our space, our, our peers, our friend's space, and our school space. Right. We wanna make sure everyone is safe. Oh,

Speaker 3 (04:07):
Did we have anything due today?

Speaker 2 (04:09):
Well, let's, we can talk about that later. Okay.

Speaker 3 (04:14):
Okay. Alright. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (04:15):
Ask our norms. All right. And Nina, can you tell what, um, tell us what it looks like and sounds like when we walk in the school hallway when we go to specials.

Speaker 3 (04:26):
Um, I think it probably wanna be quiet and pay attention to like, or get ready for what we're about to do.

Speaker 2 (04:35):
Yep. And we wanna make sure we give our friends in front of us and behind us some. Right.

Speaker 3 (04:40):
Boring. Yeah. This is boring. Why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (04:46):
I know it can be a little boring sometimes, Jayla, but when we come back from vacation, since she's had a long break from school, we wanna make sure that everyone remembers the school norms and classroom norms before we get started. Okay. That way we can get right back into our routine.

Speaker 3 (05:02):
That makes sense. That makes sense. I hear that. Okay.
