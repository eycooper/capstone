Speaker 1 (00:04):
And stop simulation. Good morning class. Mr. Siegel here. I'm very excited. Hi. Hi. Hi. I'm very excited to be with you guys today we're gonna start off with the discussion about, uh, behavioral expectations. Behavioral expectations for our class are important so that we can create a fun and safe classroom environment. So, would anybody like to start us off today? What is one, uh, way that we can be respectful in the classroom? Anybody raise your hand or clap?

Speaker 2 (00:44):
Okay. Um, if you don't stop talking to me, woo. I can help you with your uns project. I don't need

Speaker 1 (00:51):
Mina. Hey, Mina. And Will right now. Mia and Will. Right now we are having a discussion as a group on our behavioral expectations. Do you guys have, uh, one way that we can be respectful in the classroom? You mean you will?

Speaker 2 (01:05):
Um, like not having side conversations?

Speaker 1 (01:10):
That's a great idea. Why would we not have side conversations? Why is it important to, to keep our eyes and ears on the teacher you speaking?

Speaker 2 (01:20):
Text my mom. Um,

Speaker 1 (01:24):
Emily, let's put our phones away for now. We'll keep going with, um, okay. Why is it important to have our eyes on the teacher?

Speaker 2 (01:33):
Um, cause like nobody can hear the teacher and, um, it disrupts things.

Speaker 1 (01:40):
That's a

Speaker 2 (01:40):
Great idea. I, for the, um, classroom norms, cause I, um, did it last year in my class. I can, um, get my pencil out. Just start, um, tv, track of it, T-shirt. Do you want me to,

Speaker 1 (01:51):
Carlos, after we go through our three classroom expectations, I'll ask you to write them down afterwards. Is that okay?

Speaker 2 (01:59):
Oh,

Speaker 1 (01:59):
Thank you for help. So we'll had a great start keeping our eyes and ears on who is speaking. That way we can be respectful. Carlos, do you have another classroom expectation that we can, uh, have for our class today?

Speaker 2 (02:15):
I dunno. Okay. Did you hear what the teacher just said?

Speaker 1 (02:20):
Hey,

Speaker 2 (02:22):
You shut

Speaker 1 (02:23):
Up. Will, let's talk about, Hey. Thank you. Eyes and ears back on the teacher. Remember how we talked? This is a great example of our classroom expectation of having our eyes and ears on the teacher. So when someone is speaking, let's make sure we have our calm body, eyes and ears on the speaker. Okay? Thank you. Okay. All right. Emily, can you give us a classroom expectation how we can be respectful today in the classroom?

Speaker 2 (02:51):
I think you said

Speaker 1 (02:54):
For sitting quietly. Yes. Keep going. Or Emily?

Speaker 2 (03:00):
Um, no cell phones.

Speaker 1 (03:02):
Why should we not have our cell phones out during class?

Speaker 2 (03:06):
Oh, um, cause interrupt things. I always tell my mom I can't answer it, but sometimes she text me.

Speaker 1 (03:13):
Okay, so when no cell phones in the classroom, you can avoid

Speaker 2 (03:17):
The science fair today. Um, I wanna Carlos, my topic by you. Thank

Speaker 1 (03:22):
You much Sarah. Tonight. Carlos, we didn't talk about our, huh? We can talk about your project after our discussion. Keep thinking, keep thinking of our classroom norms because you're gonna be our scribe for when we over the three expectations are ready. Okay. I'm gonna have you so keep thinking, okay? Keep thinking of these ideas. I'm gonna have you write them down afterwards. All right. So we have, I

Speaker 2 (03:41):
Have one.

Speaker 1 (03:42):
Yes. Would you like to contribute to a classroom expectation?

Speaker 2 (03:45):
Um, everybody's gotta raise their hand before they talk.

Speaker 1 (03:50):
Okay. So that's a good idea. Why should we raise our hands before we speak?

Speaker 2 (03:55):
Who's this boring? Why are we doing this?

Speaker 1 (03:59):
We are doing this so that we can have a safe and respectful classroom. Dayla. Carlos, keep going.

Speaker 2 (04:06):
Sorry. Um, well you gotta raise your hand because then everybody gets a turn to talk and we're not interrupting each other.

Speaker 1 (04:16):
Okay? So let's review R three classroom expectations we've gone over today. Carlos had we had Wait our time.

We have Carlos who said let's, let's raise our hand or wait our turn to speak. We had from Mina and will an off call out and end simulation.
