Speaker 1 (00:01):
And stop simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:05):
Hello class. So today we're going to, hello. So today we're going to review three classroom, um, expectations that we set for group meeting. Um, so the first one is raise your hand to be called on to answer. Ask a question. Can someone show us what this looks like?

Speaker 3 (00:27):
Oh, I can. Okay. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

Speaker 2 (00:30):
Okay. Carlos?

Speaker 3 (00:33):
Yes. Raising your hand.

Speaker 2 (00:34):
Perfect. And so when we're raising our hand, um, should you be calling out as you're raising your hand or should you be quiet?

Speaker 3 (00:42):
I don't wanna talk about it. Just leave me alone. Ok. I wanna help you with entire project this year. Will you had problems last

Speaker 2 (00:50):
Year? Hello Willie.

Speaker 3 (00:51):
Quiet Nina.

Speaker 2 (00:54):
So this brings us to our next expectation and speak one at a time and not over someone. So this time I was talking and then you two were talking on the side. So it's hard to hear the instructions that I'm giving.

Speaker 1 (01:08):
Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2 (01:08):
<affirmative>? Yes. So our next one, um, our next expectation was speak one that time not over someone. So if you had some

Speaker 3 (01:16):
I got a text.

Speaker 2 (01:18):
Emily?

Speaker 3 (01:21):
Yes.

Speaker 2 (01:21):
Yes. Sorry. Yes. Thank you. So I was talking so if you needed to ask a question or you had something to share, what should you have done?

Speaker 3 (01:30):
Um, well, was my mom texting me? So I just answered, but I have tell her not to. Yeah. You shouldn't be texting in class. And, um, anyway, do you want me to write down the, uh, the rules for doing teacher? Cause I'm, I'm usually in class and I can, um, write everything down.

Speaker 2 (01:49):
Yes, that's fine if write those down. So if you have question something to answer, um, or you wanted share opinion. Remember our first rule was, first expectation was to raise your hand. Yes.

Speaker 3 (02:04):
If you don't stop talking to me about this, I'm gonna tell the principal, just shut up.

Speaker 2 (02:23):
What were we were saying about not talking over someone? It's not being respectful, which is one of our classroom rules. If you're talking and I can't share what I'm saying. Thank you. So if you have anything else you'd like to share, please let me know and we can talk about it afterwards. Okay. Thank you. Okay, so then the third one is to be polite to one another. What are some examples of ways that we can be polite to one another? Jayla?

Speaker 3 (02:54):
Um, just fine. Like not interrupting people when they're talking and to not have conversations.

Speaker 2 (03:02):
I like that one. And I liked how you raised your hand, Jayla. That was our first expectation.

Speaker 3 (03:07):
Can we talk about my science fair project today? I wanted my topic with you before I start tonight. I have some ideas about it. Um, can we, um, together and talk about that,

Speaker 2 (03:17):
Carlos? I would love to talk about that after we finish reviewing our expectations. But remember what I said, if you have a question or you have something you wanna share, remember to raise your hand. Okay?

Speaker 3 (03:27):
Oh, right. Okay.

Speaker 2 (03:28):
Thank you. So we're gonna review our three expectations one more time. Can someone remind me what the first one is?

Speaker 3 (03:38):
Hi Ken.

Speaker 2 (03:40):
Remember what we said we were gonna do? Yes. Carlos,

Speaker 3 (03:44):
Raise your hand.

Speaker 2 (03:45):
Yes. Okay. What's our second one?

Speaker 3 (03:53):
Why are we doing this? This is so boring.

Speaker 2 (03:58):
I know. May find it boring, but this is something important that we have to do so that we can make sure that we're all able to learn and be respectful of one another while we're meeting. So the second one was to one at a time and not over someone. So can someone show me how you would want to, um, share that idea with me? Yes. Jayla?

Speaker 3 (04:23):
Can I talk

Speaker 2 (04:24):
Now? Yes.

Speaker 3 (04:28):
Okay. Like

Speaker 2 (04:28):
That. Perfect. That was a great example. And then what's our last one? Will and Nina, remember what we said about not having side conversations? Nina?

Speaker 3 (04:38):
Well, me, I'm not trying to talk to

Speaker 2 (04:42):
Her. I know. I just wanna

Speaker 3 (04:44):
Help him with his Science Fair Project and make arrangements

Speaker 2 (04:48):
School. Yes, Nina. But remember what we said, we would do this after we are having a conversation. When you're talking to Will. While I'm talking, he can't hear the instructions that I'm giving. So then he can't be the best learner that he can be. So we can talk about it after this. Okay? Okay. Thank you.
