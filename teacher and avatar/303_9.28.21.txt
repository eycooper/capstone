Speaker 1 (00:00):
So begin simulation. Hello.

Speaker 2 (00:10):
Hi guys. Welcome to class.

Speaker 1 (00:14):
Hello.

Speaker 2 (00:16):
Today we're,

Speaker 1 (00:18):
Hi.

Speaker 2 (00:18):
Today we're gonna be talking about some expectations that we have when we come back to class. So the first thing that we need to do is make sure that we're bringing our attention to class and we're ready to learn. That means that we're gonna stay in our learning space and in our learning area, which is our desks. We're gonna make sure that we have

Speaker 1 (00:36):
Sit up. Nina. I'm sitting, sitting up. Yeah. Here. Sorry. Sit up.

Speaker 2 (00:48):
Make sure we're bringing our learning attitudes to class.

Speaker 1 (00:52):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (00:52):
So after we have, we make sure our desks are set up. Everybody has their papers and their name tags, and they're ready to go. Now we're gonna make sure we're listening the first time when we're asked to do something. So when I ask you to do something,

Speaker 1 (01:06):
Oh, my mom is sending me a text. I'm sorry. I wonder if I forgot something home.

Speaker 2 (01:12):
Emily. We have to make sure we are bringing our attention to the work and that we're staying in the workplace mindset. And we're here to focus. Okay.

Speaker 1 (01:21):
Sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:23):
So when you're asked to do something the first time, make sure that you follow directions and you listen and do it to the best of your ability. Just like Emily just did when I asked her her first time to put her phone away and stay focused, she listened to me, will a part of our staying in our workplace and being ready to work. Cause that was sitting up straight and we're

Speaker 1 (01:45):
Sorry. Focused. Sorry. I was just really tired. I, I sit up way too late last night. I'm sorry. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:55):
Well, I'm glad you're bringing your learning attitude and listening to me. The first time I tell you to sit up, the next thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna leave all of the crazy things that we did over the weekend or at home, at the door, and we're

Speaker 1 (02:07):
Gonna come to the birthday, birthday party. Yes. It's, it's a jump. Oh, yes, yes.

Speaker 2 (02:16):
Everything at home, at the door. And we're here to learn and we're here to talk with each other about school and bring our attention to school.

Speaker 1 (02:22):
Okay. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:29):
So the next thing that we need to do to make sure we're ready to learn is that when we're talking to each other, we're only talking about classwork or schoolwork, and we're listening to each other and giving each other good feedback. Yeah. Jayla, what's your question?

Speaker 1 (02:44):
Um, I'm just gonna say, I think one norm it would be good would be like to, you know, um, not just show up on time, but um, just be ready to work every day. Like, have your reading done and just be ready to go.

Speaker 2 (02:58):
Absolutely. That's a great idea. I'm so glad you shared that with everyone and you listened and were active in our discussion. Just like Jayla said, it's,

Speaker 1 (03:05):
Oh, I wanted to mention, um, you know, I was finally able to see Ironman over the weekend and lemme tell you what a what a film it was. Carlos.

Speaker 2 (03:15):
I'm glad, I'm glad to see Ironman. But we have to remember we're talking about classwork and school and class. Uhhuh.

Speaker 1 (03:21):
<affirmative> and

Speaker 2 (03:22):
Time to talk about Ironman at lunch. Just not right now.

Speaker 1 (03:25):
Okay. Gotcha. Gotcha. I'll be ready. I'll be ready guys.

Speaker 2 (03:29):
So yeah, just like Jayla said, we're gonna make sure that we all come to class prepared with our work done and we're ready to discuss it and, yep. Emily, what's your question?

Speaker 1 (03:39):
I think, uh, a good norm would be like to make sure you're safe around your fellow classmates. It's like you don't run or throw things or no horse horseplay.

Speaker 2 (03:52):
Yeah, Emily, that's perfect. We wanna make sure that we're always focused on what we're doing and we're not being crazy in the classroom. It's unsafe. Like Emily's mad when we're running around and being crazy. We have to bring our classroom behavior. Yep. Will, do you have a

Speaker 1 (04:06):
Question? Was there a book report? Do you mean to No, just got back from vacation. Will I thought there was a book report. Yes. I'm sorry, I was just confused as usual. <laugh>, sorry.

Speaker 2 (04:20):
Have something due. I'll make sure to communicate with that. That

Speaker 1 (04:23):
Was good. Okay, good. Good. That's

Speaker 2 (04:26):
Good. And we'll make sure that we don't have to ask our friends in class, so,

Speaker 1 (04:29):
Cool. Cool.

Speaker 2 (04:30):
Yeah. And then last thing that we wanna make sure we're doing is that we're raising our hands when we wanna talk.

Speaker 1 (04:36):
This is boring. Why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (04:41):
Jayla? It's important to talk about these things so that when we're learning, we are all focused on what we're doing and we're making the most of our time together.

Speaker 1 (04:50):
Okay. Okay. Gotcha.

Speaker 2 (04:55):
So yes, like I said earlier, it's important that we're raising our hand when we're talking and we're not blurting out in class and that we make sure we know when we're supposed to be talking. So,

Speaker 1 (05:07):
All right.
