Speaker 1 (00:00):
Weekend simulation. Hi, teacher.

Speaker 2 (00:06):
Hi. How was everyone's vacation?

Speaker 1 (00:10):
Good. Good,

Speaker 2 (00:11):
Good. I'm glad you all had a good vacation. So today we're gonna be talking about our norms for our class. Do y'all remember us talking about norms before?

Speaker 3 (00:21):
Oh

Speaker 1 (00:22):
Yeah. I think we should have one where we don't have any cell phones in the classroom.

Speaker 2 (00:27):
Yeah, that's a good one. Carlos. I agree. They can be a big distraction, right?

Speaker 1 (00:33):
Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2 (00:33):
<affirmative>. I agree. All right. So we had three norms that we talked about.

Speaker 3 (00:37):
Sit

Speaker 1 (00:38):
Up straight,

Speaker 3 (00:40):
Sit up,

Speaker 2 (00:42):
Listen to this.

Speaker 1 (00:42):
I am

Speaker 2 (00:44):
Nina. Remember, our first norm actually is listen to the speaker. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, make sure you're listening to the person speak. If it's me, if it's your classmate, it's good to be respectful and listen to the speaker. So thank you. You're doing a great job. Thank you so much. So that was one. Number two is to keep your hands to yourself. Do we remember this one? Sorry. Of okay.

Speaker 3 (01:12):
Sending you text. I forgot something.

Speaker 2 (01:17):
Emily. Something.

Speaker 3 (01:19):
Oh,

Speaker 1 (01:23):
Forgot.

Speaker 2 (01:25):
Oh, okay. Um, can we look at that later after we talk about our norms? I can help you out with that. Okay. So our second one was to keep your hands to yourself. There's a lot of people in the classroom. Sometimes

Speaker 1 (01:39):
Stayed up too late last night. I'm

Speaker 2 (01:42):
Stayed up too late. Will, I'm so sorry. I'll give you a little bit of a break later. I, I know how that feels. And the last one, our third norm is others, how you want to be treated. So if you want someone to be kind to you and be nice to you, you should be kind and nice to others. Right? Do we remember that one?

Speaker 3 (02:02):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah.

Speaker 2 (02:03):
Good. That's all of the three norms. Does anyone have any questions or maybe some that they would like to add?

Speaker 1 (02:10):
Hey, Emily, are you gonna go to jump today after school?

Speaker 3 (02:15):
I dunno. I, I'm not sure. Hey,

Speaker 2 (02:18):
Emily? After school?

Speaker 3 (02:20):
Yeah.

Speaker 2 (02:22):
So I hope,

Speaker 1 (02:25):
Yeah. Oh yeah.

Speaker 2 (02:27):
Does anyone else wanna share something fun that they're doing?

Speaker 1 (02:33):
Um, I got a norm. If you want one. Please

Speaker 2 (02:36):
Do. I would love to

Speaker 1 (02:37):
Hear your, think that, um, like everybody needs to focus.

Speaker 2 (02:42):
Focus. Yes. That's a good one. I will add that to our list. I love that one. Focusing is so important. And that goes with listening to the speaker. I think keeping focus on the speaker. That's great. Thank you, Jayla.

Speaker 3 (02:54):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

Speaker 2 (02:56):
Anyone else wanna

Speaker 1 (02:57):
Share? You're welcome.

Speaker 2 (02:59):
Thank you.

Speaker 1 (03:00):
Well, I have something to share. I saw, I just saw the Ironman movie this summer. I saw it twice. Did anybody else? It was so cool. Will, did you see it?

Speaker 2 (03:11):
I didn't see it, no. Did anyone else see the Ironman movie? Nobody else? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. That's exciting. Carlos, was it good? You saw it twice. It must have been good, right?

Speaker 1 (03:23):
Yeah, it was super great. I love the, um, I love the Marvel movies. Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2 (03:28):
<affirmative> good. That's great. Anyone else wanna share? Yes. Emily?

Speaker 1 (03:39):
Everyone else's space? Like you don't run around. No. Touching other people's face,

Speaker 2 (03:44):
That kinda stuff? Yes. That's a great one. That goes with number two. Keep your hands to yourself. Maybe we can add to that and say, keep your hands to yourself and off of other's space too. That's great. Emily, thank you so much.

Speaker 1 (04:01):
Mina. Mina. Is our book report due today? Will did you William? I'm not sure I, yeah, I mean, I didn't know.

Speaker 2 (04:12):
Well, I'm sorry. Can we focus back on the speaker? Did y'all have anything that you wanted to share?

Speaker 1 (04:18):
No, ma'am.

Speaker 2 (04:20):
Okay. Thank you so much. I think that's all of our norms. Y'all did a great job. Thank you for sharing. And thank you for coming up with some great norms.

Speaker 1 (04:31):
Uh, well, yeah. Uh, this is so boring. Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (04:43):
Well, you know, Jayla, we were just on vacation and we need to get back into the school mode, right? When you're on vacation, you're not thinking about school. We act. We wanna be focused on how we act in school, right?

Speaker 1 (04:55):
Yeah, for sure. Teacher. Sure.

Speaker 2 (05:00):
Thank you asking.

Speaker 1 (05:03):
You're welcome and simulate.
