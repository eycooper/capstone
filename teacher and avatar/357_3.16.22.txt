Speaker 1 (00:06):
Begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:16):
Am I supposed to,

Speaker 1 (00:18):
Oh, oops.

Speaker 2 (00:20):
Say the norm. Oh, okay. So I just go. Okay, everybody, welcome back. Hi. Hello.

Speaker 1 (00:31):
Welcome back. How was your vacation?

Speaker 2 (00:34):
It was great. How was yours?

Speaker 1 (00:38):
Oh, it was great. Thanks. Yeah, I spent a lot of time with my cousins <laugh>.

Speaker 2 (00:44):
I'm glad to hear that. Well, now that everyone's back, I just wanted to go over a few ground rules and just make sure that we all remember our norms. Um, for this class,

Speaker 1 (00:55):
We'll sit up. I'm sitting up. Pay attention. I'm paying attention.

Speaker 2 (01:05):
Will Mina, are you guys okay?

Speaker 1 (01:09):
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm great. Cute.

Speaker 2 (01:13):
All right. Well, one of our norms that I think we need to talk about again, is to treat others how we treat others with respect and kindness. Um, another thing that I wanted to go over was following directions. Um,

Speaker 1 (01:28):
Oops. Oh,

Speaker 2 (01:32):
Um, oops. Is someone on their phone? Mom

Speaker 1 (01:35):
Is sending me a text. Yeah. No, my mom is sending me a, I wonder if I forgot something at home.

Speaker 2 (01:43):
Emily. Now's not the time to be on our phones.

Speaker 1 (01:48):
Sure, sure. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:50):
And that's probably another one of the rules that we should go over whenever. Um, we're in the middle of class, we need to make sure that we're not going on our phones to be Will, are you paying attention?

Speaker 1 (02:03):
What, what? Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry. I, I think I just, I don't know, stayed up too late last night.

Speaker 2 (02:12):
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. But whenever we're in a lesson that everyone should be following directions and listening to the teacher not going on our phones. Um, and when I Oh,

Speaker 1 (02:26):
Oh, Emily, are you coming My birthday party tomorrow,

Speaker 2 (02:32):
Jayla? Yeah,

Speaker 1 (02:33):
Of course. I wouldn't

Speaker 2 (02:35):
Listen right now.

Speaker 1 (02:37):
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:40):
That was something I was just gonna say. We shouldn't, whenever someone's talking, we shouldn't interrupt. And especially you can talk about those things at a more appropriate time.

Speaker 1 (02:53):
Sure. Yeah.

Speaker 2 (02:56):
Okay. And another thing is, um, I, if you guys ever need anything, I'm here for you. So just remember that if you ever need to talk or you have any problems, that's another thing I wanted to remind everyone on. So, again, the norms should be that we should treat others with kindness and respect. Um, not be calling me.

Speaker 1 (03:20):
Oh, I completely forgot. I saw Iron Man for the first time over the break. I meant to lead with that when you asked about vacation. It was on the tip of my tongue. It was so good. I gotta tell you, I haven't seen that before. My dad finally let me worth it. Emily, worth it.

Speaker 2 (03:39):
That's

Speaker 1 (03:40):
That's great, Carlos.

Speaker 2 (03:42):
Carlos, that's great. But like I had said earlier, I know that everyone's very excited about their vacations and what they got to do over break, but this is not the time. Now that we're on our a different discussion, this isn't the time to be talking about that. But it was great that you saw that and that you shared.

Speaker 1 (04:04):
Thanks. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (04:06):
It's all right. So, again, I know this, it's a very exciting time. We just came back from break and it's kind of hard to get back into the routine of things, but we need to make sure that everyone's following the directions. Yes. Emily.

Speaker 1 (04:20):
Hi. I wanted to say something. Perhaps we could be more respectful of each other's space, like time.

Speaker 2 (04:29):
Okay. I think that's a great idea. Emily, thank you for sharing and raising your hand.

Speaker 1 (04:35):
Oh, crap. Mina. Did, did we have a book report due today? I don't think so. Are you sure? Yeah, yeah. No, I, I think I wrote it down and then, oh, crap. And then I forgot what I wrote down. Well, why don't you look and read it? Yeah.

Speaker 2 (04:55):
I don't think we should be saying those type of words in class. And

Speaker 1 (05:00):
This is boring. Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (05:06):
Alright, everyone, it's important that we go over these norms so that we can have a productive and oh,

Speaker 1 (05:15):
End simulation.
