Begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:09):
Good morning class. I'm Ms. Tachi. How are you all today?

Speaker 3 (00:13):
Good teacher. Good, good,

Speaker 2 (00:17):
Good. That's good to hear. So today we're gonna go over and review just three expectations that we should have during small groups. So one is raise your hand if you would like to share. So can you, can I see what raising your hand looks like? So,

Speaker 1 (00:33):
Um,

Speaker 2 (00:35):
Yeah. Good. Emily, Carlos, you guys Nice. So when we wanna share our thought, so you raise our hand so then we can, um, the others can share and listen. Nina up here please. Okay, thank you. Our second expec, uh, expectation is to be active listeners. So when we're listening to others, we should be using our ears and listening and engaging to what others are saying. Just how if someone is sharing, you'd want them to be respectful to yours, which goes into our last expectation is to be respectful, respectful to others, and to yourself and to me when in small group. So do you guys have any questions about any expectations or if you wanna add any more expectations we should have for a small group. Emily, is everything alright?

Speaker 3 (01:39):
Yeah, I got text from my mom. Um, I have, um, sorry Emily, but I have a lot of ideas about, um, classrooms that we could, um, you do for once now overnight we can change em up.

Speaker 2 (01:56):
Okay. Um, Emily, um, after small group, we can talk about, um, whatever's going on with you. Um, if that's all,

Speaker 3 (02:07):
Sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:07):
No worries. Yeah, we can talk about it. Um, Carlos, did you have any ideas? You're trouble, Nina,

Speaker 3 (02:17):
You,

Speaker 2 (02:29):
Um, so Carlos wants to share and one of our ex uh, expectation is to be active listeners. So when others are talking, we wanna hear what they have to say all after class. You guys can talk about that all. Hi Carlos. Would uh, what would you like to share?

Speaker 3 (02:46):
Just, um, we could come up with some new forms for after the break. That one we had before break, but, um, yeah, but now, um, we could come up with some different ones. Like, like could we get up and stretch at certain times during the day that copy one of our norms?

Speaker 2 (03:03):
Oh yeah. That's a great idea. I I love an idea of having like a brain break and stretching and having our body ready. We're

Speaker 3 (03:11):
Ready. Um, are we doing that today?

Speaker 2 (03:18):
Yeah, of course. Um, after small group we can talk about that. Uh, maybe during lunch.

Speaker 3 (03:23):

Speaker 3 (03:40):
Alright. Okay, good.

Speaker 2 (03:42):
Uh, so can someone share one of the expectations that we talked about today during small group?

Speaker 3 (03:51):
Be kind.

Speaker 2 (03:53):
Be kind as one. Yeah, that could be for the active listeners. When we're listening to others

Speaker 3 (03:58):
Boring, why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (04:01):
Well, we have to make sure that we know our expectations with, um, each other. So then when we're sharing and discussing during small group, then we know what the

Speaker 3 (04:09):
Expectation,

Speaker 2 (04:11):
