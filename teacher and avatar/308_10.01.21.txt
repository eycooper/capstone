Speaker 1 (00:00):
<affirmative> begin simulation. How was your vacation?

Speaker 2 (00:09):
Mine was really good. I'd love to hear how everyone else's was.

Speaker 1 (00:14):
Mine was good. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Yeah, it was good, but it was too short.

Speaker 2 (00:19):
Too short? Yeah. What about you will? Yeah.

Speaker 1 (00:22):
Oh, it was good. I was at camp a lot. I was away most of the summer. Well, I went to see a lot of movies. There were tons of movies that came out this summer, so. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

Speaker 2 (00:33):
That's wonderful. I love movies. Emily, what did you do?

Speaker 1 (00:42):
Not much. Not much. Are we gonna do, um, norms, because I have a really quick one.

Speaker 2 (00:49):
Yes. We are going to do norms. So who can remind me of one thing that's really important to do when we enter the classroom?

Speaker 1 (00:58):
Uh, sit down.

Speaker 2 (00:59):
Sit down. Yes. And should we be running around being noisy and not starting our work right away? <laugh>, who can give me an example of another norm? Well,

Speaker 1 (01:17):
You need to, um, sit up. Well sit up. It's ok. I'm sitting up. Shush.

Speaker 2 (01:25):
It's okay. Will can take care of himself. Who can gimme an example of another norm?

Speaker 1 (01:33):
Oh, I got a text from my mom. Oh. Oh gosh.

Speaker 2 (01:39):
I don't know what phone's having out as a part of one of our norms.

Speaker 1 (01:43):
You're sending me a text. Wonder if I forgot something at home.

Speaker 2 (01:47):
Emily. We can check that later. I'm sure everything's fine. Okay.

Speaker 1 (01:51):
Okay. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:52):
No, it's okay. Jayla, do you have an example of a norm you'd like to share with us?

Speaker 1 (02:01):
Uh,

Speaker 2 (02:04):
Looks like Will's having sleep.

Speaker 1 (02:07):
Stay up straight up. Wait last night.

Speaker 2 (02:11):
So it sounds like when we come back from a vacation, we need to remember that we need to get sleep for school. That's how we can get our work done.

Speaker 1 (02:21):
Hey, are you gonna to jump, um, today? Are we gonna go? Yeah, it's gonna be my birthday party. You gonna come? I sent you an invitation. Are you coming?

Speaker 2 (02:30):
Emily, Jay?

Speaker 1 (02:31):
I dunno. I'm

Speaker 2 (02:32):
Not norms right now.

Speaker 1 (02:35):
Okay. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:36):
It's okay. I just think we've forgotten how to act in the classroom. We've been out on vacation for so long, but I wanna respect you guys and I need you guys to respect me. That's how we learn together.

Speaker 1 (02:49):
Okay,

Speaker 2 (02:51):
Carlos, do you have a norm that you'd like to share? What's something we always need to do in the classroom?

Speaker 1 (02:58):
Um, well, I mean, yeah, I'm trying to think. But, um, you know, I saw the Iron Man movies, uh, this summer. They were so good. I loved the Iron Man. Um, movies. Well, um, have you seen any of those? They're so cool.

Speaker 2 (03:15):
I have, but remember that's not what we're talking about right now. We had our share time and it's awesome that you went to the movies, but we're talking about how to refocus and get ready to learn in school. Now, later on when we do writing, I'd love for you to write about the Ironman movies. Does that sound good?

Speaker 1 (03:32):
Yeah. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Okay, teacher.

Speaker 2 (03:35):
Thank you. Let's see. How should we

Speaker 1 (03:43):
I have one.

Speaker 2 (03:44):
Oh, you do, Emily. Okay.

Speaker 1 (03:47):
Uhhuh. <affirmative>. I think that, um, we should, uh, the classroom norm should be respectful at other, other people's space and like, not running, not touching other people's things, that kind of stuff.

Speaker 2 (04:01):
Yes. That's a great one. That was gonna be my next one to share with you all. I think respect and treating each other with kindness is one of our most important norms. And that, what does that look like? That looks like not talking while other people are talking. Remember? Well, Mina and listening and being a good friend and treating our materials and our classmates with respect always. Thank you Emily.

Speaker 1 (04:31):
You know, uh,

Speaker 2 (04:34):
Emily will, did you have something you wanted to share?

Speaker 1 (04:39):
Nina, have you started the book?

Speaker 2 (04:42):
Will and Nina, I'm speaking.

Speaker 1 (04:46):
Nice. Okay. Sorry, teacher. Thank

Speaker 2 (04:49):
You. <laugh>. Whatever it is, it can wait until we're done with our class discussion.

Speaker 1 (04:56):
This is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (05:03):
Because we've been out of school for so long and clearly we need to remind ourselves how we act when we're in the classroom. I know it may seem a little boring, but it's important for us.
