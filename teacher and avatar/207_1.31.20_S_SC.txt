Speaker 1 (00:03):
And stop simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:09):
Good morning. Class. So today we're gonna go over the classroom expectations again because we, I think we need just a little reminder of those. So remember the first one we've talked about is compassion. Right? Everybody? What

Speaker 1 (00:27):
I just did, right? Yes. Okay.

Speaker 2 (00:31):
Everyone is doing their best. Right? Every day everyone's doing their best and sometimes their best doesn't look the same as what you think their best should look like. Well, that doesn't mean that it's not their best. Yeah.

Speaker 1 (00:42):
Don't interrupt when she's talking. Okay. Hi. Thank you guys. Okay.

Speaker 2 (00:50):
Um,

Speaker 1 (00:54):

Speaker 2 (00:55):
Nina.

Speaker 1 (00:56):
Yes.

Speaker 2 (00:57):
Thank you honey. I've got it. Okay.

Speaker 1 (00:59):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (01:02):
Um, kindness. Remember we're being, we need to try to use our, uh, our most kind words to speak to each other. Yeah. That goes along with the other one.

Speaker 1 (01:13):
Sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:16):

Okay. Uh, if you'd like to talk about that after class, we can do that. Okay. Oh no,

Speaker 1 (01:29):
It's alright. Just gimme a tag. Thanks. I leave you.

Speaker 2 (01:35):
Um, that goes a little bit into listening, right? We need to listen to whoever is speaking at the moment, if that's right.

Speaker 1 (01:44):
Oh, I wanted to ask, are we doing like a science fair this year? Um, cause I'm really into science fairs,

Speaker 2 (01:52):
So. Yes. Carlos, you

Speaker 1 (01:53):
Talked science fan if you will. Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2 (01:56):
<affirmative>. Yeah, we've talked about that before, remember? Yeah. And we'll, we'll talk about that a little bit later too. I'll give you some more specifics. Okay.

Speaker 1 (02:02):
Cool. Great. Yeah, I'd love to hear about it. Cause that's my ideas, so

Speaker 2 (02:07):
Great. I would love to hear them. Um, yes. Remember. So we're gonna listen completely to the person who's talking all the way through and, and, uh, lastly, we're here to learn, right? And if we're gonna learn, we have to do listening. Yeah. Okay, guys. Um, what did you guys, what was the best part of your weekend?

Speaker 1 (02:38):
Um, I, uh, a museum. That's pretty cool. Oh yeah. I want to Busy natural history in New York.

Speaker 2 (03:12):

Speaker 1 (03:13):
Oh, I love like, stuff about science and like science fairs. And have you thought anything about the science fair since we talked about it before?

Speaker 2 (03:24):
Um, not in, uh, not since we last discussed it, but I promise we talk about it later. Okay,

Speaker 1 (03:29):
Cool. I have ideas.

Speaker 2 (03:31):
Yes. I'm excited to hear them.

Speaker 1 (03:34):

Speaker 2 (03:35):
Uh, what about you? Mina?

Speaker 1 (03:38):
Ohk. Hi. Yeah. Bye. My dog.

Speaker 2 (03:41):
Your dog?

Speaker 1 (03:43):
Yeah.

Speaker 2 (03:43):
Very cool. What's your dog's name?

Speaker 1 (03:45):
Um, scrappy.

Speaker 2 (03:47):
Scrappy. Nice. What about you? Will?

Speaker 1 (03:52):
Um, uh, bees. I'm a big fan of bees, so, um, kind of boring. Why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (04:01):
I think it's nice to share about, um, each other's weekends to hear about each other's life because, you know, you all have a lot more that happens outside of school. Right. Gotcha. Your life isn't just school.

Speaker 1 (04:13):
Oh, that's a good thing. So Yes, good point. Definitely.

Speaker 2 (04:17):
Um, and so I think it also gives us a little bit of perspective to know what other people do at home. Uh, Carlos, I didn't hear what you do.

Speaker 1 (04:26):
Bees are dumb. What do you mean? Bees are dumb? Oh, Mina, these are dumb.

Speaker 2 (04:30):
Mina? Yes.

Speaker 1 (04:31):
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

Speaker 2 (04:33):
Does that go along with our expectations that we just talked about?

Speaker 1 (04:38):
No. No.

Speaker 2 (04:39):
Okay.

Speaker 1 (04:39):
Sometimes she just like likes to yell at me and stuff, so I get mad and like yell bad. So it's not a good relationship.

Speaker 2 (04:51):
Okay. Well it's understand,

Speaker 1 (04:52):
But here we are. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

Speaker 2 (04:54):
Yeah. Well, it's understandable to, you know, to have the, like, to get upset when other people Yeah. Um, say things that you don't agree with, but

Speaker 1 (05:04):
Yeah.

Speaker 2 (05:06):
Um, it's, it's not, we probably shouldn't handle it by telling other people how they feel and act. Right. Okay. Yeah. We just talked about things, how it makes us feel.

Speaker 1 (05:16):
Right?

Speaker 2 (05:16):
Right. The I statements we've talked about

Speaker 1 (05:20):
And, and simulation.
