Speaker 1 (00:03):
Begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:07):
Hi everyone. I'm Miss H. It's so nice to see you. Hi there. Hi. So today we are going to be creating some norms for our classroom. Can anyone raise their hand and tell me what a norm is?

Speaker 1 (00:21):
Huh?

Speaker 2 (00:23):
Yeah. Yeah. Jayla.

Speaker 1 (00:25):
Oh, it's sort a like a rule that everybody kind of agrees to follow.

Speaker 2 (00:29):
Yes, exactly. A norm is a rule that everyone agrees to follow. So when we set norms for our class, that means that these are the expectations we're going to have for everybody. So could

Speaker 1 (00:41):
You pick up my mental,

Speaker 2 (00:43):
I'm also going to set some norms just for this discussion so that we can be productive and we can help each other out. So Will and Anna, can I get your eyes facing forward please? Sorry.

Speaker 1 (00:52):
Sorry.

Speaker 2 (00:52):
It's okay. Thank you for facing forward. Um, so for this discussion, if you have an idea for a norm, I want you to raise your hand like this. Um, when other people are talking, you are not talking. We're listening to what our classmates are saying.

Speaker 1 (01:10):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (01:10):
So does anyone have any ideas for some norms we want for our class?

Speaker 1 (01:19):
Text?

Speaker 2 (01:19):
Yeah. Carlos?

Speaker 1 (01:21):
Uh, yeah. Um, I was thinking like maybe respect other people's opinions.

Speaker 2 (01:26):
Yeah. Respect other people's opinions. And how would that look in our class?

Speaker 1 (01:31):
Uh, well, you know, if somebody says something you don't agree with, uh, you hear around, oh, I also wanted to ask you about science. Do you like science? Cause I was thinking like, I have this really cool project that I came up with, uh, make a Volcano and I didn't know if I could like show it class next time I come in. Carlos,

Speaker 2 (01:49):
I love, I love how enthusiastic you are about your volcano, but right now we're setting norms after this, maybe we can talk after class.

Speaker 1 (01:57):
Okay, that sounds good.

Speaker 2 (01:58):
So just to recap, Carlos's Norm was to respect others' opinions. Does anyone else have another norm that they would like to share?

Speaker 1 (02:07):
Yeah, it should. Bem shouldn't be able to tell me what to do. Well, if you knew what to do, I wouldn't have to tell you when I Oh, you're so mean.

Speaker 2 (02:19):
Will and Mina, we are going to talk after class. Okay. Um, but will I also want for this norm setting discussion to be something that's respectful. Okay. And so when we're setting the norms, it needs to be something for our whole class and it does not need to be targeted at anyone in class. Okay. Okay. Does that sound good?

Speaker 1 (02:38):
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I was gonna think of a think of something actually. Okay. I was thinking like, showing up on time is important.

Speaker 2 (02:44):
Yeah. That's a very good norm. Showing up on time. Yeah. Cool. And why is it important that we show up on time to class?

Speaker 1 (02:52):
Well, if we do that, then like we all be on the same page. You all kind of learn

Speaker 2 (02:58):
Together. Yeah, exactly. I love that. So we're gonna be on the same page. Everyone's going to be organized. Perfect. That

Speaker 1 (03:05):
Was, oh, we should totally have a, a science fair this year. That's a great idea.

Speaker 2 (03:10):
Carlos. Sorry. A science fair is a wonderful idea for a final project Maybe, but since norms are something that we're going to hold each other accountable for in the class. Okay. That just wanna as a norm. But I will keep that in my mind. Thank you.

Speaker 1 (03:24):
Okay,

Speaker 2 (03:25):
Welcome. What about other norms for our class? Can I get one more? One more volunteer? Yeah. Mina.

Speaker 1 (03:33):
Hi. Yeah. Maybe, um, no social media or like texting, taking pictures. Has someone said that

Speaker 2 (03:42):
Or no? No one said that. I think that that's a very good point. So why is it important? So are you saying that we should not be on our phones during class? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why is it

Speaker 1 (03:51):
Important? Why are we, um, this is boring. Why are we doing this? It's me, Jayla.

Speaker 2 (03:56):
Well, Jayla, I think that we're doing this well. I know that we're doing this because we want our class to be organized. We want it to be productive and we wanna be able to have fun in this class. So these norms are really important for all of us to be able to get along and help each other out while we're in class. Um, okay. I'm gonna go back to Mina. Mina. Your norm I think is wonderful. Why is it important that we don't have phones in class?

Speaker 1 (04:21):
Well, will, over here. Let's text. Don't you will. Oh, I don't, yeah, you did. No, I don't.

Speaker 2 (04:30):
Mina will can I get attention back on me? Eyes on your case?

Speaker 1 (04:34):
Sorry.

Speaker 2 (04:34):
So like you talked about before, when we're setting norms, this is a place where we're going to respect each other. We're not going to target each other. So that means only having positive things to say about our classmates. Yeah. Alright. We do that. So right now we have three norms. Carlos said that we should respect each other's opinions, will had the great contribution that we should all be on time. Mm-hmm. And Mina said that we should not have phones in class. So we're not texting not on social media. We are present.
