Speaker 1 (00:00):
Begin simulation, my teacher.

Speaker 2 (00:08):
Hi class. How are y'all today? Hello.

Speaker 1 (00:10):
Good, how are you?

Speaker 2 (00:13):
I'm good. How was your day?

Speaker 1 (00:16):
Good. We just got back from vacation.

Speaker 2 (00:19):
That's awesome. Where'd y'all go?

Speaker 1 (00:21):
Summer vacation.

Speaker 2 (00:24):
Cool. That's cool. So today in class I wanna talk about classroom norms. Do you know what classroom norms are?

Speaker 1 (00:32):
Yeah, it's the rules.

Speaker 2 (00:35):
Yeah. Do you have an example of what one of those rules might be?

Speaker 1 (00:40):
Well, you need to pay attention. The teachers talking. I am paying attention. Mina, be quiet. I know, but you're not sitting up straight. I am sitting up straight. Nina, be quiet. Can you hear the teacher Nina? She's talking. Nina.

Speaker 2 (00:59):
Nina, please

Speaker 1 (00:59):
Be quiet and leave me alone.

Speaker 2 (01:01):
Nina. Yeah, please.

Speaker 1 (01:07):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (01:08):
Okay. So that's actually a really great example of a class norm that we could have is respecting personal boundaries. What does that mean?

Speaker 1 (01:19):
Oh no. I got a text from my mom. Oh, brother. Why is she texting me? I must have forgotten something. I gotta check my text.

Speaker 2 (01:32):
Is everything okay Emily?

Speaker 1 (01:34):
Um, well my mom sent me a text, so I'm just wondering why. I'm just checking it.

Speaker 2 (01:41):
Okay. Make sure everything's all right with your mom. But once you're done with that, make sure you put your phone away, okay?

Speaker 1 (01:46):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (01:47):
Okay.

Speaker 1 (01:49):
I tired. I stayed up too late last night.

Speaker 2 (01:54):
That's relatable. Will. Um, so back to class norms. Someone mentioned Will, will have you fallen asleep.

Speaker 1 (02:07):
Well, no, I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:11):
I'm here.

Speaker 1 (02:13):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (02:14):
Okay. Thank you for waking up. When I, um, question. That's a great example of respect. That's one of the question.

Speaker 1 (02:20):
Are you going to the fun zone? Um, I

Speaker 2 (02:25):
Don't Jayla, I

Speaker 1 (02:27):
Dunno. I dunno. Jayla, I check my mom. Okay. After school. Excuse.

Speaker 2 (02:35):
So that's, yeah. So when I'm talking as a teacher, it's, I find it very respectful when y'all are quiet and listen and that will be reciprocated. So when y'all talk to me, I will also be listening to you. Yes, Jayla.

Speaker 1 (02:50):
Yes, ma'am. Um, like, yeah, I think one of our norms should be like, everybody needs to focus.

Speaker 2 (02:56):
Yeah. That's a really, really great norm. Um

Speaker 1 (03:00):
Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2 (03:01):
<affirmative>, that's really good for the classroom because that'll keep us on task and it'll help us learn the material that we need to learn.

Speaker 1 (03:08):
Yeah. Yeah. But guys, I saw the new Iron Man movie this summer and it was so cool. But we talk about that. I love Marvel movies. Oh my gosh, that was such a great movie.

Speaker 2 (03:20):
That is a really great movie. I'm glad you got to see such a cool movie over summer break. But do you think that we could hold that conversation for maybe during lunch or after class? I would love to talk to you about that another time.

Speaker 1 (03:30):
Oh, oh, okay. Thanks teacher.

Speaker 2 (03:33):
Whoa. Of course. Um,

Speaker 1 (03:37):
Let's see.

Speaker 2 (03:38):
Yeah, so what Jayla was saying, oh yes, Emily.

Speaker 1 (03:42):
Um, well I was thinking that we could have a norm that like everybody needs to respect everybody's space. Like not running, not touching other people's things, that kinda stuff.

Speaker 2 (03:54):
Absolutely. That's a wonderful normal, I'll write that down. Um, as well as Jay's that she brought up earlier, that is a great norm because it reminds ourselves to keep within our own boundaries and respect other people's because people might have different boundaries.

Speaker 1 (04:08):
And we do, we have a book report due today. I dunno, but you're interrupting. I dunno if have book thought. Somebody said something on.

Speaker 2 (04:20):
Excuse me. Will

Speaker 1 (04:21):
Mina. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah.

Speaker 2 (04:24):
Do you remember our, um, our class Norm about staying quiet when someone else is talking?

Speaker 1 (04:30):
Oh yeah. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (04:31):
No, you're totally fine. Um, at class norms take a lot of practice and I'm proud of you guys for workshops. This

Speaker 1 (04:37):
Is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (04:43):
Well, it's so, it's boring. Some things in life are boring, but that doesn't mean that they're not important. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you have to go through the everyday things because these establishing these norms are gonna make it. So we have a great class this entire year, which I am very excited about starting with you guys.

Speaker 1 (05:00):
Okay. Teacher? Yeah.

Speaker 2 (05:04):
Yeah.

Speaker 1 (05:05):
Oh, thank you.
