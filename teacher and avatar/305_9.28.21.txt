Begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:05):
Hello.

Speaker 1 (00:07):
Hi.

Speaker 2 (00:10):
So we are gonna go over our classroom norms. Um, does anybody have anything that they remember from before break? That would be a classroom norm?

Speaker 1 (00:23):
Hmm? <affirmative>. No cell phones, maybe.

Speaker 2 (00:29):
No cell phones. That's a good one. And why would we not use cell phones?

Speaker 3 (00:35):
Hmm. Sit up

Speaker 1 (00:39):
And I am sitting, sitting up. Need to pay attention. Which stop.

Speaker 2 (00:46):
You're right. Mina. Are you paying attention? Paying attention is a good classroom.

Speaker 1 (00:50):
Oh yeah. Absolutely. I totally agree. Totally agree. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>,

Speaker 2 (00:57):
You wanna pay attention and not use our phone so that we can respect our peers. Yeah. Um, does anybody else have a norm? They think is a good one for our

Speaker 1 (01:07):
Classroom? Oh, no, my mom. Oh no, my mom is sending me a Yeah, text. I'm sorry. Sorry. Must have forgot something. Sorry. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:21):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Well, we typically try not to text in class, right? Because we wanna listen to our peers in conversation. Gotcha.

Speaker 1 (01:28):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Sure. Sorry, sorry about that. Oops. <laugh>.

Speaker 2 (01:35):
How about being kind to ourselves and others as a norm? Will, are you engaging with the class?

Speaker 1 (01:48):
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just kinda, you know, I stayed up a little too late last night. Uh, sorry. Whoops.

Speaker 2 (01:58):
That's alright. But let's try and

Speaker 1 (02:03):
I should drink more coffee. Whoop. Sorry, Emily. Emily, are you gonna come into my birthday party? Oh, wait,

Speaker 2 (02:15):
Jayla, we're having a conversation about classroom norms. Yes.

Speaker 1 (02:19):
Oh, I was just, I was just, um, checking in with Emily about a, about about after school. So, yeah, it's her, it's her birthday, so,

Speaker 2 (02:28):
Well, we're in school right now, so we're talking about in school stuff.

Speaker 1 (02:33):
Okay. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:34):
That's all right.

Speaker 1 (02:37):
Oh, um,

Speaker 2 (02:39):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Jayla.

Speaker 1 (02:40):
Yeah. I was gonna say like a good, a good norm would be maybe showing up on time and just being ready to like, work with whatever, you know, homework we had or reading we have to do and just being kind of ready to start the day.

Speaker 2 (02:55):
Yeah. Being prepared and showing up on time so that we can be respectful of our own time and others' time. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Thank you. That was a good one. Does anybody else have one?

Speaker 1 (03:05):
Oh, oh, I was gonna say I saw Ironman over the weekend, which was amazing. I mean, I'd never seen it. I know. I'm like way behind on that. Um, he liked, that's

Speaker 2 (03:16):
Iron Carlos,

Speaker 1 (03:18):
Who's I'm pretty behind on, but, uh, you know, I'm catching up with his storyline. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, Bob Downey Jr. So amazing. Love it.

Speaker 2 (03:26):
Good stuff. You know, I think it's very cool that you wanna share that with us, but that's another good classroom norm, is to make sure that we focus on tasks and share things when it's appropriate to share things. So maybe we can set aside certain times when you can share things like that with the class, Emily.

Speaker 1 (03:43):
Yeah. I think, uh, another good norm would be maybe, uh, like being respectful of other people's space. Like, not, not running or throwing things or stuff like that.

Speaker 2 (04:01):
No. Yeah, that's a good one. You wanna be respectful of each other's things. That's absolutely right. Oh, and why would we do that? Because we don't want our

Speaker 1 (04:08):
Thing. Did we have a book report you today? I thought we had a book report, didn't we? No. No. Well, what are you talking? Can't pay attention. Yeah. But, but I don't wanna like,

Speaker 2 (04:19):
Hey, will,

Speaker 1 (04:20):
It's another assignment.

Speaker 2 (04:21):
We would talk about that later. Right? And we're talking about classroom norms right now.

Speaker 1 (04:27):
Okay. I just thought there was a book report and I just kind of flipped. Sorry, I got a little nervous. <laugh>.

Speaker 2 (04:31):
That's okay. But what could you do if you have a, have a question like that? Who could you ask? This is,

Speaker 1 (04:38):
This is boring. Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (04:42):
We're doing this so that we can make sure that we are all being efficient and productive in our classroom and respectful to others, right? We wanna have some norms so that our day goes smoothly, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Gotcha. I'm sorry that you think it's boring. Oh, sometimes boring things during the day

Speaker 1 (04:57):
It happens. Okay. Um, hmm, hmm. And.
