Speaker 1 (00:02):
And start simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:07):
Hello, class. So today we're gonna be going over our, um, three rules for our class, our three expectations for our class today.

Speaker 1 (00:15):
I like, thank you

Speaker 2 (00:17):
So much. It's new. All right, so let's go to our first expectation. Our first expectation is being respectful. So I wanted to ask you guys, what does that look like? What does being respectful look like in our classroom? Does anybody have any idea?

Speaker 1 (00:29):
Looks like this

Speaker 2 (00:31):
Looks like this. Well, listening. Yeah. Being respectful. Being part of being respectful is listening. Right? What else does being respectful look like or sound like?

Speaker 1 (00:39):
Um,

Speaker 2 (00:40):
Anybody have any a ideas?

Speaker 1 (00:40):
Quiet.

Speaker 2 (00:41):
Quiet. Sometimes it's being quiet. Other times it's participating in giving your voice, right? Well,

Speaker 1 (00:47):
I think that, um, you better start working on your, you. Well, I mean, I well, you

Speaker 2 (01:02):
Can we guys, can we finish this conversation after class? Maybe? Thank you. Well, that was a very respectful way to tell Meina to pay attention. I like that. All right, so, so being respectful, who are we being respectful towards? Anybody have any ideas?

Speaker 1 (01:18):
Oh no. Oh, I got a text.

Speaker 2 (01:21):
We got a text. We shouldn't have your phone with you. That's not part of being respectful, right?

Speaker 1 (01:27):
Yeah. Oh, um, yeah, it was my

Speaker 2 (01:30):
Mom. Oh, sorry. Oh, it's okay. So Emily, what is, um, who should we be respectful towards? Who are people that we should be respectful towards?

Speaker 1 (01:37):
Um, our

Speaker 2 (01:38):
Classmates. Our classmates, right? Who else?

Speaker 1 (01:41):
Oh, I have a lot of I ideas about classroom norms. I can give you a whole list from last chair if you wanted. Teacher, um, do you want me to start listing them for you? Um, I know

Speaker 2 (01:50):
My heart. Let's just keep going with our classroom norms that we have said already. So number two, let's move on. Number two, our second classroom norm is try your hardest. What does that mean? What does that look like? Anybody have any idea of what trying your hardest looks like? Jayla, thank you for raising your hand.

Speaker 1 (02:04):
Uh, it means, um, I'm doing all the work that you're asked to do and even if you don't wanna,

Speaker 2 (02:12):
Sometimes it looks like that. What else does trying your hardest look like? Anybody have any idea?

Speaker 1 (02:19):
Stop talking to me about this. Shut up. I have a really good topic for you. Nina will

Speaker 2 (02:26):
Have

Speaker 1 (02:27):
Time with clients.

Speaker 2 (02:28):
They'll shut

Speaker 1 (02:29):
Up. Nina

Speaker 2 (02:30):
Will. Was there a nicer way to ask Nina to be quiet? Maybe.

Speaker 1 (02:34):
I

Speaker 2 (02:34):
Dunno. She more respectful.

Speaker 1 (02:36):
Love about

Speaker 2 (02:37):
This.

Speaker 1 (02:38):
She's nagging me about my science project. She's trying to help.

Speaker 2 (02:42):
I understand that's frustrating. Will, but there's also more respectful way you can tell somebody to stop talking to you. What do you think that is? What's a spec respectful way to do

Speaker 1 (02:50):
That? Just ignore her.

Speaker 2 (02:53):
Ignore her. Maybe. I don't know if that would work. Maybe just asking her to be quiet and then if that doesn't work, maybe asking me to help. What about that?

Speaker 1 (03:01):
Please be quiet. Mina. Yeah. Yeah, that would

Speaker 2 (03:05):
Work. I like that. Alright, so try

Speaker 1 (03:08):
The science fair. I'd like to my topic with you teacher. Can we talk about the science fair

Speaker 2 (03:13):
Now? You know, it would be a great time to do that at recess. How about that, Carlos?

Speaker 1 (03:17):
Oh, okay. All right. I have a good topic. I wanna make sure you

Speaker 2 (03:21):
Have program. Okay, we'll talk about it at recess. All right. So trying your hardest. I have a question for you guys. Does trying your hardest look the same for everybody? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? No. That's right. So it's kind of dependent on who you are as a person, right? So trying your hardest could look like you're talking a lot and you're interjecting into the discussion. But for some people, that's really hard for them. And maybe saying one thing is trying their hardest in the discussion, right?

Speaker 3 (03:48):
Right,

Speaker 2 (03:48):
Right. All right, so let's move on to our third, um, expectation. Our third expectation is being responsible. What is being responsible? Oh

Speaker 1 (03:54):
My gosh. Why are we doing this? This is so boring.

Speaker 2 (03:58):
Well, we wanna come over our class expectations multiple times throughout the year so you guys are aware of them. And so we can maybe update them and we think that they're not working. So being responsible is our third expectation. So what does that mean for you guys? What does that mean for you, Jayla? Being responsible.

Speaker 1 (04:15):
Um, doing what you say to do. Everybody else has to do it too. Anybody? Same page.

Speaker 2 (04:21):
Does anybody have any other ideas of what being responsible means? Do you guys agree with Jayla?

Speaker 1 (04:28):
If you do not stop talking. I'm gonna take this to teacher. Well, science there for the last time. Shut up.

Speaker 2 (04:43):
Okay. Well, remember when we talked about being respectful and our first expectation?

Speaker 1 (04:47):
Okay. What about her being respectful of

Speaker 2 (04:50):
Me? Well, part of being respectful also is not talking when other people are talking, right? Nina? Yeah. Yeah. That's kind disrespectful. Thank you for apologizing. All right, so being responsible. What do you guys, what else do you guys think being responsible means?

Speaker 1 (05:06):
Um, bringing your homework.

Speaker 2 (05:09):
Great. That's one way to be responsible and.
