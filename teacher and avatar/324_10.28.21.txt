Speaker 1 (00:01):
Begin simulation. Hi teacher.

Speaker 2 (00:05):
Hey guys. Can you hear me?

Speaker 1 (00:07):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

Speaker 2 (00:09):
I saw that everyone had a good vacation.

Speaker 1 (00:13):
Yeah, it was good. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. That's good. How was your vacation?

Speaker 2 (00:18):
It was really good. It was really good. But now let's get focused onto school. And now that we're in a setting where we learn, let's review some classroom norms just in case that we didn't forget while we were having fun during vacation. Does that sound okay?

Speaker 1 (00:34):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

Speaker 2 (00:35):
Okay. Could anyone tell me what are some norms that we all discussed as a class previously?

Speaker 1 (00:44):
Um, I think we said no cell phones last year. Is that right?

Speaker 2 (00:48):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. That's a good one. Why should we not have cell phones? So that we can be focused and stay in tune, right?

Speaker 1 (00:56):
Sit up.

Speaker 2 (00:57):
Sit up.

Speaker 1 (00:58):
I am sitting up.

Speaker 2 (01:00):
Hey Nina. And Will

Speaker 1 (01:03):
Could

Speaker 2 (01:03):
You guys listen? Yeah. I think this is one great example of what we should not do, right? When Carlos was talking, what is something that we should have done instead of talking to each other?

Speaker 1 (01:14):
Um, listen.

Speaker 2 (01:15):
Right? Yeah. So let's move on. Let's kind of tie that into our classroom norms. I think something that I really like is respect and that is something that should always be, um, in our classroom. Text

Speaker 1 (01:27):
From my mom. My mom is,

Speaker 2 (01:28):
Hey Emily. Text Well. Hey Emily, what was our first role that Carlos kind of talked about in the beginning? He said no cell phones, right?

Speaker 1 (01:38):
Oh, sorry. Okay.

Speaker 2 (01:40):
Yeah. And Nina, well this is a good example what we should be doing. Good job for being very quiet and attentive to me as I was talking. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Good job guys. What are other norms that we can bring up to the class? What are other rules to abide by?

Speaker 1 (01:58):
I stayed up too late last night. I'm

Speaker 2 (02:01):
Hey Will, is that very important to the conversation or is that distracting the learning of others?

Speaker 1 (02:08):
What's that? Sorry. Straight up, late

Speaker 2 (02:11):
Last night. Sit up. Hi. Yeah. Sit up and head up. Hi.

Speaker 1 (02:14):
Good job.

Speaker 2 (02:15):
Alright. Good job. Does anyone else have any ideas on what classroom norms that we want?

Speaker 1 (02:20):
Are you gonna jump today after school? Um, I dunno. I ask my mom. That's probably why she texted

Speaker 2 (02:27):
Kayla and Emily.

Speaker 1 (02:28):
Most of us are gonna meet there. Yeah. Kayla, Emily.

Speaker 2 (02:31):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative> Is that being respectful to our class and our time? Are you respecting ma'am? My time here?

Speaker 1 (02:38):
No, sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:40):
Yes. I, this is all a really good reminder of what we should, we should focus back onto school and the setting that we're in. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> where we are learning and being respectful. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> and being kind and passionate towards other people as we're talking. And especially to me, we're trying to respect me as much as we are respecting each other. And I know that you guys don't wanna be interrupted when you guys are talking, right? Why would I just slump on my chair?

Speaker 1 (03:05):
I tell you, teacher, I saw the Ironman Ironman movies. Um, uh,

Speaker 2 (03:11):
Well Carlos, is that relevant talking about right now? Is that relevant?

Speaker 1 (03:16):
I dunno. I just love those Marvel movies. Teacher.

Speaker 2 (03:21):
Yeah, I understand that, Carlos. But could we save that for another discussion time? Maybe during recess maybe, or lunch. But not right now. Cuz we're reviewing and it's my time that you are respecting. Yes. Emily?

Speaker 1 (03:35):
Um, well I was thinking a classroom norm. Yeah. It could be respectful of people's space, like around them at their desks. Like not catching other people's thing.

Speaker 2 (03:46):
Yeah. I really like that. I, I think it's important because it is our own material and since we mm-hmm <affirmative> have brought our own thing, it is respectful to be respectful of other people's space and Yeah. Yeah. Do you have more to say, Emily? Is that good? I really like that. Thank you for contributing to the conversation. Does anyone else have any class norms that we wanna include in our Nina?

Speaker 1 (04:11):
Do we have a book report due today? Cause I think I forgot it. I think we were supposed to write one for today. Nina. I don't know.

Speaker 2 (04:20):
Hey guys, I couldn't wait for you guys cause the time is just running out and

Speaker 1 (04:26):
Well, I was wondering if we should get a book report. Yes. Yes. Sorry,

Speaker 2 (04:33):
What do we just talk about? Could you tell me what the classroom norms are? What have we discussed so far?

Speaker 1 (04:40):
Oh, this is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (04:45):
We are doing this because there's instances like right now where we are not respecting my time and the time of others and we should be staying in tune with the classroom and what we're learning because we don't wanna disrupt other people while we're learning. I know. Okay. Other people haven't contributing. Right.

Speaker 1 (05:04):
And simulation.
