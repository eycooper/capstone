Speaker 1 (00:00):
Uh, so we will begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:07):
Hi class.

Speaker 1 (00:08):
Hi there.

Speaker 2 (00:09):
I hope you all have a good summer vacation.

Speaker 1 (00:13):
Oh yeah, we did.

Speaker 2 (00:15):
Okay. So to start off the school year, we're gonna go over some class norms. Do you guys know what class norms are? Go ahead and raise your hand if you do, if you can raise your hand. Oh

Speaker 1 (00:27):
Yeah, they're like rules or, um, you know, things to follow for us. Kinda good class.

Speaker 2 (00:35):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. There are rules, there are things we wanna follow to keep everyone

Speaker 1 (00:38):
Safe up.

Speaker 2 (00:41):
Let's, we're paying attention. Okay. Nina?

Speaker 1 (00:43):
Okay. Sure.

Speaker 2 (00:44):
Okay. So where I want us to all be involved in making up our class rules, right. Since we all are in this class. So I'm gonna go ahead and say, uh, a rule I think that we should all have, I think we should all raise our hand before we speak. Okay. Just to make sure that everyone gets a chance and so we're not talking over each other. Okay. So that's gonna be our first classroom rule. Raise your hand if you have something to say. Okay. Especially during instruction.

Speaker 1 (01:12):
Oh dear. I just gonna, you

Speaker 2 (01:14):
Ok?

Speaker 1 (01:15):
Yeah. Yeah. Um, I just gotta text from my mom. I guess. I left my lunch at home. Oh dear. Sorry,

Speaker 2 (01:22):
Emily. Let's try not to, let's try not to use our phones. That could be another good one, right? I think.

Speaker 1 (01:27):
Oh yeah, I think so.

Speaker 2 (01:29):
Yeah. I think your mom could always get in touch with us if she really needed to. Okay. So how about Mina? Would you like to, uh, Carlos, we'll start out with Carlos. What's, uh, classroom norm you think we should have? What rules

Speaker 1 (01:43):
Should? Um, I think, you know, showing up on time and kind of always being ready to work, uh, and participate. I think that's a pretty good, uh, that's a good start, I think.

Speaker 2 (01:52):
Yeah, Carlos, those are both great rules to follow. We definitely will add them to our classroom rules. We just wanna make sure we try to show up in time if, if we can. And, um, yeah. Emily, what about you?

Speaker 1 (02:06):
Oh dear. Um, oh, I'm sorry I fell asleep. Um, ok. Well, oh, Jay, are you gonna bed? Birthday party? Yeah.

Speaker 2 (02:17):
Emily, do you a norm you'd wanna share? We have birthday party. Sorry. Let's talk about that.

Speaker 1 (02:23):
Sorry, I got distracted. Um, I think that, uh hmm. No eating in class is good. I think that'd be distracting.

Speaker 2 (02:35):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. No eating in class unless we're really hungry. Or it's the morning when we have breakfast sometimes and some students may eat breakfast in class. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, let's try to keep it to our snack time and our lunchtime. Go ahead. Dayla, what do you think?

Speaker 1 (02:48):
Yeah, I just had another, um, norm suggestion. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, uh, maybe, uh, you know, if you're having a tough time like, you know, with work or, or with something, with an assignment, um, to ask for help.

Speaker 2 (03:00):
Exactly. Ask

Speaker 1 (03:01):
For help, you know, just kinda, yes. You know,

Speaker 2 (03:05):
Ask for help, let me know. Uh, you can always take a break and chill out and calm down the corner over here. Okay.

Speaker 1 (03:13):
Oh, you know, I wanted to mention everybody. I finally got to see that first, um, iron Man movie and

Speaker 2 (03:20):

Speaker 1 (03:25):
Oh, okay. Mm-hmm. Sorry. Yep.

Speaker 2 (03:27):
Yep. Will No problem. Will, do you have a classroom norm that you'd like to share?

Speaker 1 (03:33):
Um hmm. Well I think I did it before, but maybe like youre sleeping in class. Uh, cause that could be I dozed off before and that's not good, so.

Speaker 2 (03:44):
Yeah. Yeah. We'll try not to sleep in class. Sometimes we're really tired, but we, we, we wanna stay awake so we learn. Right. Go ahead Emily.

Speaker 1 (03:53):
I be respectful. Running or like kicking things that aren't yours. Things like that.

Speaker 2 (04:04):
Yeah, exactly. Be respectful of people's space and their feelings too. Right. We don't wanna say mean words that can hurt people. No.

Speaker 1 (04:12):
Nina, did we have homework? We didn't Homework.

Speaker 2 (04:15):
Well, well let's make sure we're paying attention, okay. Because Nina hasn't Oh

Speaker 2 (04:30):
Awesome. Do you have a classroom?

Speaker 1 (04:33):
Um, sure. Uh, I think you best. Yeah. Hard card handing your things in on time. I think it's good handing working in on time. It's

Speaker 2 (04:46):
Good. That's a great norm to have. And it's kinda like Jayla at two, right? Yeah. Always try to keep um, if we're frustrated, if we are, if we're having a hard time mm-hmm. Come after happy.

Speaker 1 (04:57):
This is boring. Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (05:00):
We're doing this so that we can set up some rules right? Uhhuh. So that we can follow the rest of the year. Right. I know it's not always the most fun thing, but we have to do it.

Speaker 1 (05:09):
And simulation. Alright.
