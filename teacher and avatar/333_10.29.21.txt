Speaker 1 (00:00):
Session to start. Uh, so we will begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:07):
Hey everyone. Welcome back from break. I'm so glad that you're all here. Um, how was your break?

Speaker 3 (00:13):
Hey there. Oh, it was great. It was great. How was yours?

Speaker 2 (00:16):
It was great. Thank you Carlos. Um, well I'm glad that we're back at school. I thought since we haven't been here, while we might talk about some of the things we like to do at school, some of our norms so that we could, so we could all regroup. Well, so one of the ones I was thinking of was attentive listening. Um, remember how we talked about that at the beginning of the year? Um, so that would mean, um,

Speaker 3 (00:37):
Sit up. I am sitting up. What do you mean,

Speaker 2 (00:40):
Nina? Attention?

Speaker 3 (00:41):
I'm paying attention.

Speaker 2 (00:43):
Nina.

Speaker 3 (00:45):
Attentive

Speaker 2 (00:45):
Listening means that it, it's one of our roles that falls under respect, right? So it means mm-hmm <affirmative> looking at someone who's talking, not talking when someone else is talking. Um, you wanna make sure other people know that you're listening to them fully. Jayla, do you have any ideas what attentive listening could be in our class? Do you remember?

Speaker 3 (01:05):
Um, whoa. Uh, who is that's, sorry. That was a me. Sorry. That's my mom. She was just texting me. I think I left something at home. I'm sorry. Sorry about that. She's just texting <laugh>. Sorry. Sorry about that.

Speaker 2 (01:22):
So that could be another example of attentive listening, right? Yeah. Like what? Listening to each other and making sure that we're focusing on the people

Speaker 3 (01:29):
That, sorry,

Speaker 2 (01:31):
Emily, do you have any other ideas that go with attentive listening?

Speaker 3 (01:37):
Ooh. Um, I think, you know, pay attention and not talking when someone else is talking.

Speaker 2 (01:44):
Right? Yeah. Those are both good parts of it. Hmm. Um hmm. So Will, what about you? Do you have any ideas?

Speaker 3 (01:52):
Um, I, uh, oh, sorry. I'm just, oh, sorry about that. Just stayed up late last night. I'm sorry about that. Sorry. Um, yeah, uh, I think, I think, uh, what Emily said makes sense. Yeah.

Speaker 2 (02:12):
And you reminded me

Speaker 3 (02:14):
What's my,

Speaker 2 (02:15):
Oh hey.

Speaker 3 (02:17):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (02:17):
Will, you reminded me of the other to talk about, which is be respectful of other people and helping keep helping to take care of each

Speaker 3 (02:24):
Other.

Speaker 2 (02:25):
So one way that we could take care of each other was, well, since you were tired from school, um, from staying up late last night. Yeah. I know that you might be a little tired tonight and we can be sensitive to that.

Speaker 3 (02:35):
Yeah. What are some ways, sorry about that.

Speaker 2 (02:37):
That's okay. What are some other ways we can look out for each other at school?

Speaker 3 (02:43):
Um,

Speaker 2 (02:44):
Jayla, thanks for raising your hand. What, what was your idea?

Speaker 3 (02:46):
Yeah, I think, I think, um, let's see, showing up on time is always good. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I think, you know, I'm being ready to work at the beginning of class, stuff like that.

Speaker 2 (02:56):
Yeah. That's another part of being respectful. Right. And that kind of goes with listening cuz you're coming, you're ready, you're ready to learn. You have all your materials.

Speaker 3 (03:03):
Yeah. Oh, I wanted to mention, you know, I, I finally got to see one of those Ironman movies I'd heard so much about. Um, I'm not so much into comics, but lemme tell you, I really enjoyed it. Um, I'm probably late, you know, late to the party, but mention to that folks, it's good stuff if you haven't seen it. So

Speaker 2 (03:22):
That's very cool. Carlos. Um, can for now, can we talk about our norms and then later today when we break into small groups. Okay. I'd love to hear about the movie that you watched, cuz that sounds great.

Speaker 3 (03:31):
Oh yeah. Yeah. That'll be fun. No problem. No problem.

Speaker 2 (03:34):
So Carlos, do you have any ideas about how we can take care of each other at school? How we can look out for each other? Hang on Emily, I'm gonna give Carlos a chance. Calling you.

Speaker 3 (03:45):
Okay. Um, I think, uh, maybe, oh, I don't know. Uh, maybe like not running in class. That be good. You know, just kind of being respectful of people's space.

Speaker 2 (03:55):
Yeah, that's a great idea. Being respectful of people's space, helping keep your body safe, other people's body safe. Um, that's a great one. Emily, what was your idea?

Speaker 3 (04:04):
Um, I was gonna say like, uh, just be um, treat people the way you would wanna be treated. I think that'd be good.

Speaker 2 (04:12):
That is a great one. Right. So that's this idea of I wanna take, we wanna take care. Want to take care us

Speaker 3 (04:18):
Today? No, we didn't have a book report due today. Oh. Uh, I'm sorry. I thought, I thought we had something due today, but I guess we don't. No, because it's the first day after vacation. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. Misunderstood. Okay.

Speaker 2 (04:35):
That's okay. So one way too will that I was thinking,

Speaker 3 (04:38):
So this is um, boring. Why are we doing this? Why are we doing this? I'm sorry. I forgot why.

Speaker 2 (04:45):
Alright, hang on Jayla. So Will, like I was saying, um, we can kind of think about what our class is doing so we can keep each other on track. Maybe that could be a way that we take care of each other. Okay. Jayla, what were you saying?

Speaker 3 (04:56):
Oh no, I was saying this is boring. I just didn't know why we were doing this. That's all.

Speaker 2 (05:00):
Yeah. It's a good way for us to regroup cuz I think sometimes when we've been at home for a long time, uh, we do things the way we do 'em at home.

Speaker 1 (05:08):
All right. Well that is the end of your simulation.
