Morning.

Speaker 2 (00:15):
Um, today we're gonna go over our classroom expectations. Um, so I'm gonna give an example and then we'll have a chance to talk about how we might show these. Um, so one of our, um, classroom expectations is that we all show respect for others. So some examples of showing respect are raising the hand, your hand when you want to speak, using kind words and listening to the teacher and other students when they're speaking. Would anyone like to share any other examples of how to show respect for others? You could raise your hand if you want to share.

Speaker 3 (00:54):
I am sitting sitting, but I just, just a little bit have to pay attention.

Speaker 2 (01:03):
I saw that Will was looking at me. Um, so I know that he was paying attention. Do you have anything you wanna

Speaker 3 (01:08):

Speaker 3 (01:47):
Way, just put it away. Sorry. Sorry. That's ok.

Speaker 2 (01:50):
That's alright. That's something that we all have to get used to being at school and not at home anymore. So, is your phone off and a way?

Speaker 3 (01:57):
Yes, yes. Yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:01):
So we'll go ahead and add that to our way to show respect and, um, will, I'd like you to help me out with showing an example with your body.

Speaker 3 (02:10):
Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just wanted, that's

Speaker 2 (02:13):
So we'll go ahead and add, um, sitting up straight.

Speaker 3 (02:16):
Sorry. It's okay. Sitting up straight

Speaker 2 (02:20):
With eyes on the speaker. All. Let's go ahead and move on if no one's got anything else to add. So Will is showing us now

Speaker 3 (02:57):

Speaker 2 (02:58):
In the classroom. So just some ways that we can make sure. Yes, Jayla?

Speaker 3 (03:03):
Oh no, I was gonna suggest a, a norm. Um, okay. I was gonna say, you know, showing up on time is good, I think and being ready Oh. To like, work

Speaker 2 (03:14):
Showing up on time and being ready to work. I love that. Love that. I think that fits under our respect category. So I'll put it on

Speaker 3 (03:21):
There. Oh yeah, I saw, so I, I finally get to see Ironman the other day, which was really cool. Um, that, that Robert Downey do something. Uh, so <laugh> just wanted to mention that. I don't know if anybody else saw it. Maybe I'm behind here. Uh, I got just, just kind of got a superhero movie, so that sounds, sounds great. Not really knowledgeable, but Sure, sure.

Speaker 2 (03:45):
I appreciate you wanting to share some of your, um, experiences with the No

Speaker 3 (03:48):
Problem.

Speaker 2 (03:49):
At the end of the day, we'll have a little go around or we can't share something that went well and something we're looking forward to. And maybe at that point, anyone else is gonna go see that movie can share that. So we're gonna move on to the next norm, which is safety and some ways of making sure that everybody's safe is, um, always using kind words, listening to instructions from adults at the school and keeping a safe body, like walking feet in the classrooms and the hallways. Yes. Emily, thank you for raising your hand. I

Speaker 3 (04:17):
Was gonna say also like not running maybe in class.

Speaker 2 (04:22):
Yes, definitely not running. So that's why I would say walking feet because it kind of helps if you remember what you're supposed to do. So instead of running, we're gonna Right. And how about when our in, when we're in our chairs, Mina what can do while we're in our chairs

Speaker 3 (04:41):
Book report. Do what are you talking about? Oh, I was just asking Will if there was a book report due this week. Um, okay. I I think it's on vacation,

Speaker 2 (04:51):
So. Okay, good. Uh, Mina, do you have any ways that you can think of making sure that we're safe in the past?

Speaker 3 (04:56):
This is boring. This is boring. Why are we doing, doing this?

Speaker 2 (05:00):
Yeah. I'm Kayla. At the beginning of the year, we kind of do have to go over just some of the norms and expectations, which could be a review for you, especially since you've been in the school a few years. So we'll just more minutes to make sure we're all on the same page. If not everybody knows all the same things that you do about it.

Speaker 3 (05:19):
Okay? Okay. No problem. Any

Speaker 2 (05:20):
Other ideas about how we can stay safe in school?

Speaker 3 (05:24):
Hey, there. All right. We're.
