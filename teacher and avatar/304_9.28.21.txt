Um hmm. Uh, I think sitting up straight, that's a good start.

Speaker 2 (00:57):
Yeah, that's a good one. Um, when I think of being respectful, I think it's good to keep our hands to ourselves.

Speaker 3 (01:05):
Oh, sorry. Sorry, my mom is sending me a text. Sorry. Sorry. I wonder if I forgot something at home. <laugh>, sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:33):
<affirmative>. So if anyone has anything to say or you have any questions. Yes, Jayla. Good job. Yeah,

Speaker 3 (02:38):
I was just gonna say, a norm that would be really good would be like, showing up on time and also like having, you know, your work ready, whether it's like reading or, or homework, you know, and just being ready to give it your all.

Speaker 2 (02:53):
Yeah. I love that. Thank you so much, Shayla. That's another really good one. Sure. Make sure we're ready to work. We have all of our materials ready. So your notebook, your pencil, your homework.

Speaker 3 (03:05):
Oh, I wanted to mention, you know, I saw Ironman finally over the weekend. You know, I've heard so much about it and, and I'm hooked. I cannot wait to see, you know, I, I guess there's sequels and there's crossovers. Yeah. And you know, there's a whole universe. And let me tell you, um, I'm in, I'm in, I dunno if you've all seen it. I know. I'm kinda late to the game here. Probably 10 years, but nothing. Alright,

Speaker 2 (03:35):
That's a good one. Um, yeah. Emily, do you wanna say something?

Speaker 3 (03:41):
Oh, I was gonna say, uh, a good norm would be like being careful around people and like, you know, not running or throwing things or, uh, just being respectful, physically respectful with people.

Speaker 2 (03:56):
That is a great one. Thank you Emily for sharing that. Sure. It's very important we don't run in the classroom so no one falls or hurt themselves or hurts other people. And

Speaker 3 (04:06):

Speaker 3 (04:29):
Okay. Um, yeah, I was just saying, uh, for a norm. I lost my train of thought, but yeah, we should be respectful of people's, like, physical space, so

Speaker 2 (04:38):
That's great. Yeah. I think that really is,

Speaker 3 (04:41):
Is this boring? Is this boring? Why are we doing this? Why are we doing this pretty

Speaker 2 (04:45):
Well? Cause this, this is so important to establish our classroom roles, norms, so that we're all on the same page and we can be, we can be respectful towards each other. It's very important to, yeah. To be careful and safe and respect each other well.
