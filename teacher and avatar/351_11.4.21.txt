Speaker 1 (00:00):
For your session to begin, is the audio still good? Yeah, just making sure. Okay. All right. Uh, here we go. So, begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:13):
Hi there.

Speaker 3 (00:16):
Hi.

Speaker 2 (00:17):
Hello.

Speaker 3 (00:19):
Welcome back from break. I'm glad to see you all back here. Um, today, I, before we start learning, I just wanna go over our classroom norms that we agreed upon at the very beginning of the school year, if you remember those. So, first and most important one is that we need to be actively listening to each other. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So when I'm talking, I need you guys all to be sit, focus, focused. Eyes on me up here. That is what active listening looks like. I need you guys looking at me, and also I need your voices turned off. I love how Jayla is sitting there, actively listening. She's quiet with her eyes focused on me, and she is not talking. That is a perfect example of what active listening looks like. We're gonna make sure to practice that throughout the classroom for the rest of the year. Both when you guys, when I'm speaking and when you're speaking to each other. Okay. <laugh>. So when you're talking to each other, I also to this be making sure you're paying attention, listening with your whole entire body. So getting

Speaker 2 (01:18):
A text. Oh, no.

Speaker 3 (01:21):
Okay. And then the next classroom go over is respectful communication.

Speaker 2 (01:29):
Okay.

Speaker 3 (01:30):
So I need us to all be respectful when other people are speaking and I need us be looking at the speaker. I need to just be using kind words, kind body language. Does anyone have any questions about those norms that we discussed? Will, did you have a question?

Speaker 2 (01:53):
Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I, I stayed up way too late last night. I, I, I was napping. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm here. I'm awake. I'm awake now.

Speaker 3 (02:04):
Thank you for communicating that with me. I really appreciate that. Sure, sure. Make sure we're listening for the rest of class and being respectful to the birthday party. Any problems?

Speaker 2 (02:14):
Ok, I'm gonna, I think I'm gonna go to the trampoline park. Yeah, it's gonna be at three 30. Oh, should be fun. I'm

Speaker 3 (02:23):
Boys and girls. I have a question. Does actively listening mean having conversations with your other classmates while the teacher's talking?

Speaker 2 (02:32):
Uh, definitely not. Definitely not. I think that kind of flies in the face of it for sure.

Speaker 3 (02:36):
You're right, Carlos. So I want to make sure that when the teacher is talking, that everyone else is listening and not having their own separate conversations, because I could be saying something very important, like I just was.

Speaker 2 (02:46):
Okay.

Speaker 3 (02:47):
Thank you, Carlos. All right. Are we ready to get Yes, Jayla?

Speaker 2 (02:53):
Yeah, I was thinking, um, maybe one of the norms that would work would be, um, showing up on time and just being ready to work, like when school starts, you know, with our, uh, readings or homework or whatever we're working on.

Speaker 3 (03:07):
Perfect. I love what you just said. We can add that to our classroom norms moving forward. So what Jayla just said is

Speaker 2 (03:14):
That, oh, I wanted to say, I, I know what I, I did get to see the first Ironman movie, uh, over vacation. It was fantastic.

Speaker 3 (03:21):
Carlos, can we raise our hands if we have something to say and we have to make sure it's relevant to our conversation. So do you have something to add to Jay's norm of being prepared and ready for class?

Speaker 2 (03:32):
Uh, uh, I think it was more Ironman focused, so I'll, I'll just say this one out. No problem.

Speaker 3 (03:36):
Okay, perfect. Let's save that conversation for later. Alright. What Jayla said, I just wanna make sure everyone heard it. We're gonna be making sure to come to class prepared and with all of our materials and being ready to learn. Emily, did you have a question?

Speaker 2 (03:51):
Yeah, I was gonna say, you know, I think it's important to be, you know, respectful of, you know, uh, peoples space, so, you know, or things, so don't, you know, take things that aren't yours or run in class or push anyone or just Yeah. Physically respectful.

Speaker 3 (04:11):
So, perfect. I love you said a whole bunch of things.

Speaker 2 (04:14):
Have homework to be at homework.

Speaker 3 (04:16):
Hey, will, let's make sure Yeah. Emily, in our conversation, please.

Speaker 2 (04:20):
Oh, I am, I was just worried we had homework. I'm sorry. I'm

Speaker 3 (04:22):
Sorry. Emily just said that we need to be respectful of each other's materials. That means keeping your hands to yourself and not touching anyone, other, anyone else's materials. And then she also, mm-hmm. <affirmative> wanted to make sure that everyone's being respectful with their bodies and not pushing or running. So we're gonna walk in our classroom and we are gonna keep our hands to ourselves. I'm gonna go ahead and add those two to our classroom norms. Keep your hands to yourselves and use walking feet in our classroom. Ok. Everyone is

Speaker 2 (04:47):
Safe. Yeah, this is boring. Why are we doing this?

Speaker 3 (04:53):
It is very important to talk about classroom norms because we wanna have a classroom community where everyone is safe and can be listened to. Does that make sense,

Speaker 2 (05:00):
Jayla? Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Just checking. Thank you.

Speaker 3 (05:05):
Does anyone else have any more norms to add? We have respectful communication, active listening, coming to class

Speaker 2 (05:12):
In simulation. All right. Well, thank you so much for completing that simulation.
