Speaker 1 (00:00):
Begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:04):
All right. Hi everyone. Welcome back from vacation. I am sure you were very

Speaker 1 (00:08):
Hi.

Speaker 2 (00:09):
To be back. Yes. Mm-hmm.

Speaker 1 (00:11):
<affirmative>. Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2 (00:12):
<affirmative>. All right. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, we are going over classroom norms, so I need your eyes and ears and heart over here on me, please. That's one of our be respectful norms, if you remember. That's how we show that we're actively listening and engaged. Can someone remind me if I'm actively listening and I'm engaged, should I be talking to my neighbor?

Speaker 1 (00:33):
Um, no, but I wanted to suggest a norm of no cell phones.

Speaker 2 (00:39):
No cell phones. That would be a good one, Carlos, because you remembered that. To be respectful, we need to be engaged and on our cell phone. That's not me being engaged, is it?

Speaker 1 (00:49):
You need to sit up. I'm sitting up.

Speaker 2 (00:54):
Nina, do you have another you

Speaker 1 (00:56):
To pay attention?

Speaker 2 (00:57):
I'm up here.

Speaker 1 (00:59):
Hi.

Speaker 2 (01:00):
Did you have a wanted, um, remind our friends about?

Speaker 1 (01:05):
No. No. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:07):
No. Okay. Um, do you reremember, maybe you can tell me what does being prepared in the classroom look like?

Speaker 1 (01:16):
Uh, well, that's just when you have your planner, your homework, all your stuff that you were supposed to bring and backpack and you bring it to school.

Speaker 2 (01:24):
Yeah. So being prepared. Looks like having what? I need my pencil. I might come to the small group. People

Speaker 1 (01:30):
With pencil.

Speaker 2 (01:31):
I got a text.

Speaker 1 (01:33):
My mom sending me a text.

Speaker 2 (01:36):
Emily,

Speaker 1 (01:37):
I forgot something at home.

Speaker 2 (01:39):
Emily, what's going on?

Speaker 1 (01:41):
I got a text from my mom.

Speaker 2 (01:43):
You got a text from your mom? I think it can wait. Do you think it can wait?

Speaker 1 (01:48):
Yes. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:50):
Yeah, that's, but you remembered like, yeah, I have this text. It seems really important, but I know that being respectful looks like waiting, so I'm gonna wait until

Speaker 1 (02:00):
I'm tired. I stayed up too late last night.

Speaker 2 (02:05):
All right. Another one of our norms is to be safe. Will, do you think that you could help me out and remind me, what does being safe look like in the classroom?

Speaker 1 (02:16):
Being safe. Uh, sitting in your chair? Yeah.

Speaker 2 (02:21):
Safe would be sitting in your chair as opposed to maybe like standing on your chair. That would probably not be safe. Jayla, do you have another way you can remind me? Leslie?

Speaker 1 (02:30):
Emily, are you going to jump tomorrow with me? Um, we're gonna meet there after school. Um, I'm not sure I can ask my mom. Well, lemme know if you're gonna Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 2 (02:42):
Yeah. I wanted to ask if you had a way that you could remind us how we can be safe in the classroom.

Speaker 1 (02:49):
Um, everybody stay focused.

Speaker 2 (02:53):
Yep. Staying focused. You know, it would be a great time if I had something I really, really, really wanted to ask. I might write it down so that I can remember. Oh, I'm being focused. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But I wanna remind myself to ask someone this thing after we're done. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, right? Mm-hmm.

Speaker 1 (03:08):
<affirmative>. Yeah. Hmm. Uh,

Speaker 2 (03:10):
So I've hit on being prepared, being safe. Being respectful. Does anyone else raise your hand if you have another norm that I've maybe forgotten that you would think would be a great norm to add to our list?

Speaker 1 (03:23):
Guys, I saw the, um, Ironman movies, um, yesterday. Ah, that was so cool. They're so good. Did anybody else see the Ironman movies? I love Marvel comics. Hmm.

Speaker 2 (03:35):
Carlos, I think that you, you're hitting on some kind of idea, Carlos. I think that you're trying to say that maybe if you have something you want to share that we're talking about, everyone needs to listen so that they can understand what you're trying to say. Right?

Speaker 1 (03:50):
Um, maybe I was talking about the Marvel movies, actually.

Speaker 2 (03:53):
Yeah, I know. And I would really love to hear that later. But what I noticed was that if you really wanted to share somebody, you really want someone else to hear you. Right. So it's really important as one of our norms. Emily, I'll get you in a second. It's really important as one of our norms to listen to what the other person's saying, right. With your eyes and your ears and your heart. Yes, Emily. Gosh.

Speaker 1 (04:19):
To be respectful of people's space, like you're running, touching other people's stuff,

Speaker 2 (04:25):
That's an awesome norm, Emily. Being safe and being respectful is, you know, keeping your your hands to yourself. Yes. Remember friends, remember being respectful is listening to the person who's talking. And right now, that's me. All right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative> my turn. Thank you. So Emily was saying to be safe with our hands and with our stuff and with our space. Maybe not running in the classroom, maybe not shuffling.

Speaker 1 (04:56):
Oh, this is, this is so boring. Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (05:02):
We're doing this because you're right. Sometimes it is really boring and we gotta get through some boring stuff before we get to fun stuff. If you've ever ridden on a rollercoaster, they tell you like keep your hands and feet and you really don't wanna hear that. Maybe that's the boring part of the ride. But in order to have fun, we need to set some norms. Right? Well, that's why we're doing this.

Speaker 1 (05:20):
And simulation.
