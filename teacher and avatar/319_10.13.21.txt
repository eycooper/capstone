Speaker 1 (00:00):
Begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:05):
Good morning everyone.

Speaker 1 (00:07):
Hi teacher. Hi.

Speaker 2 (00:09):
How was everyone's Summer break.

Speaker 3 (00:12):
Good.

Speaker 1 (00:16):
How was yours?

Speaker 2 (00:17):
Oh, it was good. Thank you for asking. How was anyone else's?

Speaker 1 (00:24):
Mine was good. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah.

Speaker 2 (00:27):
Good. Well it sounds like most of y'all had a really good summer break. Um, since it is the first day back, I did wanna go over classroom norms with everyone. So does anybody remember any classroom norms that have been used previously?

Speaker 3 (00:41):
Yeah.

Speaker 1 (00:42):
Um, uh, no cell phones.

Speaker 2 (00:45):
Yeah, that's a great one. Carlos. Anyone else?

Speaker 3 (00:51):
Sit up. Sit up.

Speaker 1 (00:54):
I'm sitting up. Be quiet. Mina. No, you're not paying attention right now.

Speaker 2 (01:10):
Oh, okay. What about you? Will, do you remember any classroom norms?

Speaker 3 (01:15):
Um,

Speaker 1 (01:19):
No interrupting everybody.

Speaker 2 (01:21):
Yeah, that's a great one. Yeah. Thank you for sharing. Will. And Emily, I haven't heard from you yet this morning. Do you remember any classroom norms?

Speaker 1 (01:32):
My

Speaker 3 (01:32):
Mom right now, I gotta

Speaker 1 (01:34):
Look at this. My mom's sending me a text.

Speaker 2 (01:38):
Oh, actually one of the norms that Carlos reminded us of is that you're not supposed to use your cell phones in class, so it's okay for this time. I know we're getting back in the same norms, but just put it away for now, please. Okay. Are there any other norms that anyone remembers?

Speaker 3 (01:58):
<laugh>.

Speaker 2 (02:00):
Okay. Well let's talk about respect

Speaker 1 (02:02):
Too Late last night. I'm tired.

Speaker 2 (02:05):
Oh, you're tired. I'm so sorry to hear about that. Do you wanna stand up and stretch and get your blood moving a bit?

Speaker 3 (02:12):
Oh, oh, what?

Speaker 1 (02:14):
That's okay. It's her teacher.

Speaker 2 (02:17):
Sure. Yeah. Let's just talk about what respect looks like. So what does active listening look like? Does anybody know what that term means?

Speaker 1 (02:25):
Are you gonna go to jump tomorrow? Cause I'm going

Speaker 3 (02:30):
My,

Speaker 1 (02:32):
Okay, cool. We gotta meet at the flag then if we wanna get there off time.

Speaker 2 (02:35):
Hey, Jayla, Jayla, Emily. Let's, let's get back in. Let's bring it back together a little bit. Do you remember what active listening looks like? Sure. What does it look like?

Speaker 1 (02:52):
Uh, like this.

Speaker 2 (02:53):
Yeah, it does. Exactly. So you're all sitting up really straight. You're giving me eye contact. You're nodding. So that's really helpful for me cause it helps me know that you all are listening to me and I don't need to repeat anything. Great. Um, what about respecting others? What, what might we do to respect others when we're in school?

Speaker 1 (03:15):
Guys, I saw the new, um, the Iron Man movie up in the summer. It was so good. Did y'all see it? I love Marvel movies. That's

Speaker 2 (03:25):
Really cool. Have you seen all of the

Speaker 1 (03:26):
Marvel movies? Yes. Uh, quite a few. Yeah? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, have you quite seen them? That's cool. Emily, have you seen them? Yeah. They are so good. Ah, I could tell you the whole, whole movie actually right now. Maybe I will. So, Carlos, what happens in

Speaker 2 (03:42):
This entire movie? Maybe you could share the plot to the Marvel movies on a different day or maybe during recess, but that kind of brings me to our point.

Speaker 1 (03:49):
Okay. Teacher

Speaker 2 (03:51):
<laugh>. Thank you. Yeah. So respecting others means that we're not interrupting each other while we're speaking. It means that we are practicing active listening and looking at people when they're talking. So that's what most of you are doing. So great job with that. Um, and also respecting others can mean respecting their time as well. So when we're getting people distracted and we're getting people off task, sometimes that's kind of, Hey,

Speaker 1 (04:16):
Mina, do we have a book report due today? Mina, can you hear me? Mina? You

Speaker 2 (04:22):
Will hear

Speaker 1 (04:23):
The question. You answer me, please. Oh, no, I'm sorry. Go ahead. No,

Speaker 2 (04:29):
No, that's okay. You're bringing up, uh, the due date of a book report. And one big thing that we can have for our norms is the expectation that people are gonna be turning things in on time. So you asking when the book report is due, um, is really helpful because someone else might not know when it's due. And that is another norm, is that we are going to, you know, hold each other accountable and hold ourselves accountable. And

Speaker 1 (04:53):
Is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (04:57):
We are doing this because it's important that we're setting norms so that we are respecting each other while we're in school.

Speaker 1 (05:04):
Oh yeah, that's right. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 2 (05:07):
Yeah. Don't you feel like a classroom is a little bit better when everyone respects each other?

Speaker 1 (05:13):
Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2 (05:13):
<affirmative>? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1 (05:15):
Teacher <laugh>. Okay.
