My name is Ms. Kim. Hello, and I'm your teacher today.

Speaker 1 (00:13):
Hi.

Speaker 2 (00:14):
Hi. So I, today I wanted to go over some behavior expectations. Okay. So these are things that, um, will keep us safe in the classroom and they will help us learn.

Speaker 1 (00:27):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (00:28):
So the first expectation is if you have a question, I want you to raise your hands. So this way

Speaker 1 (00:37):
Keep that. Well raise your hand. Okay. Just blur things

Speaker 2 (00:41):
Out. Exactly. Can you try practicing that? Can everybody raise their hands?

Speaker 1 (00:46):
Oh, raise their hand. Sure. I can do that.

Speaker 2 (00:51):
Great. Sorry.

Speaker 1 (00:53):
Here we go.

Speaker 2 (00:53):
Thank you.

Speaker 1 (00:55):
All

Speaker 2 (00:55):
Right. So just like that. Oh, if you have a question now you can put your hands down.

Speaker 1 (01:03):
Well,

Speaker 2 (01:04):
And if you have a question that is the expectation to raise your hand and then I will call on you.

Speaker 1 (01:13):
All

Speaker 2 (01:13):
Right. And then you can ask your question. Sorry,

Speaker 1 (01:16):
I'm getting a text.

Speaker 2 (01:20):
Is everything okay Emily?

Speaker 1 (01:22):
Yeah, just my mom. Just text. Text him. There we go.

Speaker 2 (01:27):
Do you need to step out and take care of No,

Speaker 1 (01:29):

Speaker 2 (01:30):
Go ahead. Okay. Will I ask you to put your phones away? Um,

Speaker 1 (01:36):
Oh. Um, do you think we're gonna do like any kinda like cool science stuff this year? Like, uh, I was making like volcanoes over the holiday and I was thinking like maybe we can make like a, like a competitive volcano kinda competition.

Speaker 2 (01:50):
Do you remember Carlos? What behavior expectation number one is? Okay. What do you do if you have a question?

Speaker 1 (01:58):
Uh oh, right. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:00):
So go ahead and try it. You can

Speaker 1 (02:07):
Meina,

Speaker 2 (02:08):
Do you have a question?

Speaker 1 (02:10):
What? No, he's just, he's just talking. He's very disruptive. No, you sh

Speaker 2 (02:18):
Okay. That brings me to, well, behavioral expectations. So Anna and Will, if somebody is talking, it is hard to hear what the other people in the class have to say.

Speaker 1 (02:35):
Uh,

Speaker 2 (02:35):
So expectation number two is if I am talking or your friends are talking that everybody else is listening. Okay. Okay. So we will listen with our ears and we will not talk over each other. Okay. Cause that is the kind and respectful thing to do, right? All

Speaker 1 (02:55):
Right? Yes. Okay. Yes.

Speaker 2 (02:58):
And my last expectation is I want you guys to remain in your seats until the bell rings.

Speaker 1 (03:05):
Oh. Are you gonna be in charge? Are the science fair? I'm sorry. Yes. Do

Speaker 2 (03:10):
You know Carlos can't? What is Yes. Sorry. Yes. Carlos, do you have a question?

Speaker 1 (03:17):
Yeah, I was just seeing if you, if if we're gonna do like any kinda, uh, science fair stuff this year, I'm kinda like a science junkie.

Speaker 2 (03:24):
Yeah. That's really exciting. I'm gonna take notes on that. And I'm that you are a science junkie and we could definitely address that. Okay. But thank you for sharing that with us.

Speaker 1 (03:36):
Sure, sure.

Speaker 2 (03:39):
No problem. Okay, so the three expectations that I have when we meet as a class is two. Can anybody remember the first one?

Speaker 1 (03:50):

Speaker 2 (04:04):
You, you said this was boring. Why are we doing this? Well, it's really important to have expectation. It's very important to do this for two reasons. One, it keeps everybody safe. And two, it's very respectful to learn how to Yeah, well act You

Speaker 1 (04:23):

Speaker 2 (04:50):
So expectation number two is when somebody is talking, we're remaining quiet. Okay? Okay. So let's not talk over each other. If you have a question or if you want to address the group, you could raise your hand.
