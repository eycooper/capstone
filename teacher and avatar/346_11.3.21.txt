Speaker 1 (00:00):

Speaker 2 (00:07):
Hi everyone. My name's Cindy Doe. Um, I hope y'all had a great break. So today, since it's our first day back, we're gonna talk about our expectations. Okay. We're just gonna review them since it's been a while, since everyone's been in the classroom, and I'll wanna make sure everyone remembers them. Okay? So our first one is to stay on task while we're in the classroom. Okay? So this can look like, or let me ask first, does anyone remember what this can look like? Staying on task?

Speaker 3 (00:36):
Um, us looking at you. Listen.

Speaker 2 (00:39):
Yeah, exactly. Eye contact. Ready?

Speaker 3 (00:42):
I am sitting at Great

Speaker 2 (00:44):
Mina.

Speaker 3 (00:45):
You're not paying attention.

Speaker 2 (00:46):
I really like the way that you remembered how to stay on task, but one part that you just said was to looking right eye contact with the speaker. So I'd love it if you were able to look at me right, while you were reviewing this, because this is important. Yes. So we wanna stay on task eye contact. Right. We also wanna be, um, sitting at our seats. Right? Should we be running down in the classroom in the hallways when we're on task? No. No. Right? Another part is listening, right?

Speaker 3 (01:16):
Yes. Oh, no. Yes. Oh, my mom is that? Oh no, she's texting

Speaker 2 (01:21):
And another part Emily. Yeah. Of seeing on. Cause there's one speaker at a time, right? So if I'm speaking, should someone else be talking?

Speaker 3 (01:30):
No. No. My mom just texted, so I I I hung

Speaker 2 (01:34):
Up the phone. Yeah, no worries. Um, okay, so that's an important part. We wanna stay on task while we're doing our work. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. The second part is we wanna be, our second expectation or norm is being, uh, respectful to others. Right? Will. Yeah. You understand if you're tired, right? We just came a long break, but, oh, no,

Speaker 3 (01:54):
We just talked. Sorry about, sorry. I need,

Speaker 2 (01:56):
And everyone hopefully

Speaker 3 (01:58):
Listening here, we're

Speaker 2 (01:59):
Okay. Yep. Our second expectation is being respectful to others. Does anyone have an idea of how we could show that we're respectful to others?

Speaker 3 (02:07):
Oh. Um, Emily, are you coming to the birthday party? Yeah. [inaudible]

Speaker 2 (02:14):
Okay, so can everyone look at me? Where's my eye contact? My

Speaker 3 (02:18):
Eye contact. I'm sorry.

Speaker 2 (02:20):
Remember, like I said, our first expectation was, uh, staying on task, which means you are looking at me. You're listening to me because that's what we're doing right now, okay? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, so yeah, we take care of others by keeping our hands to ourselves, right. Listening when others are speaking. So if I want you to speak, right, we want everyone to be looking at you, but since right now I'm the speaker mm-hmm. <affirmative> and there's one speaker at a time, I want you all to be looking at me while I'm speaking,

Speaker 3 (02:44):
Okay? Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2 (02:45):
<affirmative>. And yeah. So our third one is to take care of the school. Does anyone have any ideas of how we can take care of our school? Yes. Jayla, thank you so much for raising that.

Speaker 3 (02:54):
Oh yeah. Oh, sure. Um, I was thinking like, you know, not littering or not a, you know, uh, you know, just being respectful. Like if you make a mess in the, in the cafeteria, you know, clean it up, stuff like that.

Speaker 2 (03:06):
Yeah, exactly. We want to leave things. Right? We could leave rooms the way they were when we came. Oh, in them, right? Right.

Speaker 3 (03:14):
We don't

Speaker 2 (03:15):
Want to mess around with the anything that, talking about

Speaker 3 (03:19):
Hot Rs.

Speaker 2 (03:20):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. I have saw idea. Carlos.

Speaker 3 (03:22):
Oh no, I just wanted to say everybody, I, I finally saw the first Iron Man movie and it was so cool and I had been so resistant.

Speaker 2 (03:29):
Wait, Carlos,

Speaker 3 (03:30):
You know, superhero movies, Carlos?

Speaker 2 (03:32):

Speaker 3 (03:37):
Going over. Oh, I was just Sharon. Just Sharon. Yeah,

Speaker 2 (03:40):
Sorry about that. Hey, that's all right. I would love to hear more about that if you could tell me more about that during recess or choice time. Okay. So as I was saying, we wanna take care of our school. We want to use materials, how they should be, right? So if I wanna take care of my school, am I gonna bite on all my pencils and kick my tables over and scratch the walls? No. Right? What should I do? Can someone gimme an example of taking care of our school? Another example, Emily, do you have an example of how we could take care of school? Yeah. Yeah,

Speaker 3 (04:05):
I do. So like, I dunno, if you get textbooks or like things from school, you should take care of them. Or if you have like, stuff holding your, your papers stuff, you should take care of that.

Speaker 2 (04:16):
Yeah. Yeah. Or I like that. Thank you Emily. Yeah, we wanna use things how they're supposed to be used, right? We don't want to anything do stand on our textbooks, like the way, um, since that's not the proper way to use it. No. Right? Please count. Oh, so Will, let's, since those are our three expectations that we're gonna go Yeah. Go over. Let's see if you all can remember them. And tell me an example. So Will, can, do you remember what our first expectation was that we went over?

Speaker 3 (04:41):
Uh, I think it was, um, keeping our hands toward Zoom? Or was that two?

Speaker 2 (04:46):
Um, that's a part of the second one, but that's okay. So how is this? Is,

Speaker 3 (04:50):
This is boring. Why are we doing

Speaker 2 (04:52):
This? So we're doing this because it's important, right? Because we want to be in a safe classroom and we wanna take care of ourselves. We wanna take care of each other, and we wanna take care of our schools. And since it's been a long break, we want to review them so that we can be in the best zone to learn. Great.
