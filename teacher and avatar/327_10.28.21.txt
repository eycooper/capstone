Speaker 1 (00:00):
Begin simulation. Hi teacher.

Speaker 2 (00:06):
Hi guys. How are you doing?

Speaker 1 (00:09):
Good, good. How are you?

Speaker 2 (00:12):
I'm doing well. Okay guys. So before we get started and hear about all the awesome things that we did over our break, I definitely wanna make sure that we go over some of the really important things that we should do while we're in our classroom every single day, okay?

Speaker 1 (00:26):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. I think that we should have one for, um, like a rule of, for no cell phone.

Speaker 2 (00:34):
Ooh, no. Cell phone's a good one. That's in our school policy too. So that's something that we should all keep in mind when we're in our school. Okay.

Speaker 1 (00:43):
Hey, well you need to sit up. I am setting up. Be quiet. Well, you need to sit

Speaker 2 (00:49):
Anna And Will Anna and Will.

Speaker 1 (00:52):
I'm Hey.

Speaker 2 (00:54):
Hi guys. Yes.

Speaker 1 (00:56):
Hi.

Speaker 2 (00:56):
So go ahead and keep all eyes on me. Let's go over some of the most important ones, okay? Okay. So for number one, I think that we should all have respect of each other. What does respect mean, guys?

Speaker 1 (01:10):
Um, it just means that like, you listen, you don't interrupt people, that kinda thing,

Speaker 2 (01:16):
Right? So when we're talking, we wanna be mindful of what other people are saying.

Speaker 1 (01:22):
Oh, I got a text from my mom. Why is she sending me a text?

Speaker 2 (01:26):
Hey, Emily, after we have our five minute break, you'll be able to check your phone, okay? Right now I would like you to put it away,

Speaker 1 (01:35):
Okay? Thank you.

Speaker 2 (01:36):
Okay. Awesome. Number two, I wanna make sure that we make sure that we lead our words with kindness.

Speaker 1 (01:47):
This

Speaker 2 (01:47):
Is one that you don't like. Oh, no,

Speaker 1 (01:51):
I'm tired.

Speaker 2 (01:52):
See, that seems like something that we should talk about on our break. Okay. How can you lead with your words with kindness? Can someone give me an example?

Speaker 1 (02:11):
Um, well speak with kindness. Um, I'm not sure

Speaker 2 (02:16):
When you wanna speak to someone else. Do you speak

Speaker 1 (02:19):
To them? Are you going jump today? Um, I dunno if I can go Jayla. My mom did. Well, maybe you can text her. Maybe you can text her and ask her. You can go to jump. Emily,

Speaker 2 (02:32):
Do you remember what Carlos said earlier about our,

Speaker 1 (02:35):
Like

Speaker 2 (02:37):
Girls?

Speaker 1 (02:38):
Oops, sorry. Yes.

Speaker 2 (02:40):
Right, right. So when you're talking to me, I expect it to be with kindness. And when you're talking to each other, I also expect it to be with kindness,

Speaker 1 (02:51):
Okay?

Speaker 2 (02:51):
Okay? Yep. And the last one that I want us to think about is allowing time to think before you speak. Okay? So before you start talking out loud, make sure that you're thinking about what you're going to say before you say it. Okay?

Speaker 1 (03:09):
Oh yeah. I mean, I, um, oh, I just saw the Ironman movie. I can't wait to tell you all about it unless you haven't seen it. I don't wanna be a spoiler, but see,

Speaker 2 (03:17):
I haven't

Speaker 1 (03:18):
Seen it yet. Love Marvel movies. Um,

Speaker 2 (03:20):
Yeah, I know. So do I I haven't seen it yet though, Carlos, so we're

Speaker 1 (03:23):
Gonna have to, do you wanna? Okay.

Speaker 2 (03:26):
Okay. Are there any questions about our three rules in our classroom? No. I have

Speaker 1 (03:34):
One though. I have one.

Speaker 2 (03:36):
Yes. Emily? Um,

Speaker 1 (03:37):
I think there should be one that, um, like being respectful of other people's space, like not running or touching other people's stuff,

Speaker 2 (03:49):
Right? So that goes a lot with our first one of respect of each other, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, that doesn't just mean mm-hmm. <affirmative> talk. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. That also means when we're interacting with someone, right? Awesome. I love those head nods. Exactly.

Speaker 1 (04:03):
Mina, do we have a book report due today? Mina. I dunno. Well, it's the first day of school.

Speaker 2 (04:11):
It's first day.

Speaker 1 (04:12):
We had to bring a book report with us on the first day of school. Mina, what do you know? I don't know. Will you better listen to the teacher? Well, I mean, but can you tell me if we have a book report too? Mina.

Speaker 2 (04:28):
Mina. We'll, why don't you wait until we're done and then we can all talk about what's due in your classes and what should we look for?

Speaker 1 (04:39):
This is boring. This is boring. Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (04:44):
Why are we doing this? Because we wanna make sure that we are all on the same page before getting started with all of our new material that we're learning. Oh, yeah.

Speaker 1 (04:53):
Right, right. Sorry about that. Gotcha.

Speaker 2 (04:59):
All righty, everyone. So remember that we're respecting each other, that we are leading with kindness

Speaker 1 (05:06):
And simulation. Thank you.
