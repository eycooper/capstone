Speaker 1 (00:00):
So, uh, we will begin simulation. Hey. Hello.

Speaker 2 (00:12):
Hi.

Speaker 1 (00:13):
Hi. How was your vacation?

Speaker 2 (00:18):
Oh, my vacation was great.

Speaker 1 (00:21):
Cool.

Speaker 2 (00:21):
Cool. Thank much for asking.

Speaker 1 (00:23):
No problem, no problem. Cool. I had a good one too. <affirmative>. Okay. So, yeah. Um, oh, wait, hold on. Will sit up. Well, I'm, I'm sitting up. Yeah, but you know, she's trying to talk. You're slouching.

Speaker 2 (00:43):
Okay, everyone, so before we begin, I wanted to go over some norms and roles that we will have in our classrooms. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, the first one is will be respectful.

Speaker 1 (00:58):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

Speaker 2 (00:59):
Um, and that means using kind words, um, to each other. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And we're going to use listening to listen to other people. We're going to be kind to each other and if we have something to say, we will raise our hands. Okay. And last but not least, getting

Speaker 1 (01:21):
A text.

Speaker 2 (01:22):
So be ourselves. Um,

Speaker 1 (01:26):
Okay. Cool. Sounds good. Yeah. Kind of tired. Alright. It's gonna be back. Sorry. Um, I have a, I have a norm that we can think of. No.

Speaker 2 (01:47):
Yes. Jayla,

Speaker 1 (01:48):
Maybe? Um, no sleeping in class. That'd be a good one. Oh, I'm awake down

Speaker 2 (01:55):
Sleeping.

Speaker 1 (01:55):
I'm awake. Sorry. I, I'm sorry. I stayed up way too late last night. I, uh, <laugh>, but I'm here. I'm here now. I'm awake.

Speaker 2 (02:03):
Hello. We can work on some strategies on how we can go to bed earlier, if that will help you be awake and aware in class.

Speaker 1 (02:12):
Oh, yes. I'm gonna go's at a trampoline place. Yeah. Yeah. It's at three. Three.

Speaker 2 (02:21):
Remember, if we have something to say, we can raise our hands.

Speaker 1 (02:24):
Oh, okay. Um hmm.

Speaker 2 (02:30):
Yes, Emily?

Speaker 1 (02:31):
Yeah. Maybe a, a good, um, a good normally be like, uh, showing up on time and being like ready to work and, uh, just having like your homework done or your reading and just being ready to participate.

Speaker 2 (02:48):
So yes, Emily, that's a wonderful idea. I think that's something that we can all learn from and something that we can all do. Thank you for sharing.

Speaker 1 (02:58):
Hmm. Um hmm. Yes, Carlos. Well, you know, I was gonna say to everybody that I, that I finally saw the first Ironman movie and, uh, wow. It was so good. Um, I'm gonna late to the party on that, but anyway, just wanted everyone to know. If you're not into superheroes, it doesn't matter cause I'm not but that movie. Wow. So,

Speaker 2 (03:24):
Okay.

Speaker 1 (03:24):
Um, there you go.

Speaker 2 (03:25):
Stay on task.

Speaker 1 (03:27):
Okay. Um,

Speaker 2 (03:28):
Carlos, can you think of a norm that we could add to the list?

Speaker 1 (03:32):
Oh, sure. Um, maybe no, uh, no eating in class. That'd be good.

Speaker 2 (03:37):
Okay. Yeah, no eating unless it is snack time or anything like that. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, yes, Emily,

Speaker 1 (03:44):
I have one too. Uh, I think, um, being, uh, mindful of people's space and you know, their stuff, so don't take other people's things, um, unless you ask them to borrow it and, uh, no running stuff like that. Yeah.

Speaker 2 (04:04):
Yes. That's, that's a wonderful idea. I think that shows that we care for our classmates, that we discuss them and their things.

Speaker 1 (04:13):
We have homework. Nina? No. Okay. Sorry. Hi. Sorry. I thought we had homework. I was wrong. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, whoops. Say about it. Yeah. Okay. Okay. This is, um, this is boring. Why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (04:37):
We're doing this because it's important that we establish these roles from the beginning. Uhhuh <affirmative> that later on. Um, we don't have any misunderstandings.

Speaker 1 (04:48):
Okay. That, that, that makes a lot of sense actually. Um, yeah. Yeah. Uh, I think another norm that would be really good would be maybe like to participate or to make sure like you participate one time every day, at least. Um, I don't know, just be end simulation. Okay. Well, thank.
