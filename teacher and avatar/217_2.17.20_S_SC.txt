Speaker 1 (00:03):
And

Speaker 2 (00:03):
Start simulation. Hi class. I'm Ms. Day. We <laugh>. Hi. Um, we are gonna talk about setting classroom norms for a minute. We're gonna choose three that we can all agree on, that we should all follow together. Do you guys have any idea what classroom norms are?

Speaker 1 (00:30):
Um, the rules?

Speaker 2 (00:32):
Yeah, they're like the rules are the expectations that we have of each other and that we want everybody to follow. Equally happy

Speaker 1 (00:41):
With you. A science project tonight. I don't need any help from you, Mina, so don't

Speaker 2 (00:46):
Come over. All right. Mina and will together for you. We can use this interruption to start with one of the norms that I think that maybe we could talk about having as having respect for each other and what that looks like. And one of those things can look like not talking while somebody else is sharing. So let's make that classroom norm. Number one is to respect one another. And by doing that or to show that we're gonna do that by not interrupting each other. Does somebody wanna volunteer a classroom Norm for number two?

Speaker 1 (01:23):
My mom.

Speaker 2 (01:25):
Okay. I have been a good idea for classroom number rule number two or norm number two. How about we leave the phones in our lockers outside of the classroom so that we have all of our attention on the teacher or what we're learning in class? How does that sound? I

Speaker 1 (01:44):
Keep the notes for the, um, the norms. I was describing my class last year. I could keep all the, um, stuff written down for teacher. Do you want me to go ahead and that I'll get my pencil out.

Speaker 2 (01:54):
That sounds great. Carlos. You can record ours and then when you're done can poster for the class so everybody knows them.

Speaker 1 (02:01):
Oh yeah. Okay.

Speaker 2 (02:04):
All right. Does anybody have something that they think that could be our third classroom norm? Okay,

Speaker 1 (02:15):
Well I help you come over. Will you shut up and leave Nina your business? Well, I just wanted to

Speaker 2 (02:24):
Help you. All right. Nina or Nina? And will I have an idea for norm number three? How about only using kind languages? Will, what's another way that you could rephrase your response to Nina so that it doesn't hurt her feelings? Um,

Speaker 1 (02:43):
Like, no, thanks. I'm good, but I keep telling her that and she keeps bugging me. Well, I just wanna help him cause I usually do well on the science fair.

Speaker 2 (02:56):
Okay. Well, you know, that is something that will, will have to, to decide for himself. And if he says that he doesn't want your help, you have to respect that and you need to leave him alone. Sorry.

Speaker 1 (03:07):
Sorry.

Speaker 2 (03:07):
Will. That's okay. I appreciate the apology from both of you to each other.

Speaker 1 (03:12):
Are we gonna talk about the science fair? I wanted to go over my topic with you before recess cause I wanna get started tonight. So what I was thinking, I might do a seashell collection or something. How does that sound to

Speaker 2 (03:24):
You? Carlos? We can revisit this later during science. So for right now, we're gonna continue okay. To talk about classrooms. Okay? So let's review our three norms. First one being respectful to one another and using kind words and by listening to each other. Second one? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Using what's, what's the second one? Carlos, you write down?

Speaker 1 (03:50):
Um, um, using kind language

Speaker 2 (03:55):
And, oh, that was the third one. The second one. Emily had to deal with something that you brought up. No cell phones. Leave them in the

Speaker 1 (04:02):
Classroom. What are we doing? This? This is boring.

Speaker 2 (04:06):
Well, good thing we just finished. So Jayla, you can share what you did this weekend.

Speaker 1 (04:14):
Um, I stayed home. I didn't go anything. Soccer game and stuff. Did

Speaker 2 (04:21):
Weekend. How did your soccer game go? Did you score goal?

Speaker 1 (04:25):
Okay. Andrew, please stop talking to me about this. The teacher already talked to you. Well, she's not listening right now, so talk about,

Speaker 2 (04:36):
Well, I actually am listening.

Speaker 1 (04:39):
Shut.

Speaker 2 (04:40):
Will

Speaker 1 (04:42):
You, do you hear her? Do you hear her sh bugging

Speaker 2 (04:45):
Me? I do hear her. Maybe. Well, we can solve this problem number one by moving you guys, you guys don't have to sit next to each other. Yes, but will I want you to apologize for using that mean language towards that we already discussed. We didn't wanna

Speaker 1 (04:59):
Use I'm sorry, Nina. Sorry. It's ok. I know I can be in pain sometimes.

Speaker 2 (05:06):
Okay.

Speaker 1 (05:07):
End simulation.
