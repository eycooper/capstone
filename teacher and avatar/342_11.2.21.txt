Speaker 2 (00:04):
Welcome back class. Give me a thumb scale for how you are doing today. So a thumbs up is I am having a fantastic day. This might be the best day ever. Thumbs down is this is not a good day for me. So you can do anywhere in between. So gimme a thumb scale with where you're at. So,

Speaker 1 (00:25):

Oh, awesome. Good. Well, welcome back to class. It's so good to see each one of you. I missed you over break. Um, to just kind of get back into the rhythm of class, we are going to go over our classroom norms. All right.

Speaker 1 (00:58):
I'm sitting

Speaker 2 (00:58):
Actually first let's, so yes, let's go over our classroom norms first. So the first classroom norm is to be respectful. So we talked about this at the beginning of the year, <laugh>, something you can do to be respectful or to use your kind words to your classmates and to me to listen to one another when another person is speaking. So if I'm speaking, having your eyes on me or showing me in some way that you're listening.

Speaker 1 (01:23):
Yes. And sorry,

Speaker 2 (01:25):
The next classroom norm is to be safe. So this one is really important.

Speaker 1 (01:30):
Sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:31):
Yeah. So being safe means to use your tools in your, at your desk. And, um, does anybody else have any ideas of another thing that you could do to be safe? Anything that we've talked about will, do you have anything to share? Any, any ideas of what can be

Speaker 1 (01:52):
Be, oh, I'm sorry. Oh, that's ok. Oh, I'm sorry. I, I was, I stayed up way too late last night. I apologize. Oh yeah,

Speaker 2 (02:29):
Yeah. That actually goes really well with my, our, our next classroom norm. Read, ready to learn. So showing up, up on time is a good one to be ready to learn and eyes up at the front kind of finding things that you're interested in while we're learning. Those are also really good things to be ready to learn. All right. Yes, Jay?

Speaker 1 (02:48):
Oh, I was thinking a good one. Um, would be, you know, no texting or like, you know, messing around on your phone. Uh, yeah. You know, while school's going on.

Speaker 2 (02:59):
That's, that's fantastic. Thank you for sharing Jayla. Yeah. So when we are in the classroom, we're focusing on what we're learning rather than focusing on things that are outside the class, which is like on our Exactly. Great, thank you for sharing that.

Not taking their stuff if they don't wanna be taken, if they don't want you to take it. Like asking first, asking permission, something that, anything else that anybody has to share.
