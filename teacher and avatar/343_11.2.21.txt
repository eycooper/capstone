Speaker 1 (00:00):
Begin simulation. Hi, Eric.

Speaker 2 (00:10):
Hey, Carlos. How are you?

Speaker 1 (00:12):
Good, good. How are you doing?

Speaker 2 (00:15):
Good. Um, before we get started, we're just gonna talk about a couple of, um, classroom norms. Do you guys, do you guys know what classroom norms are?

Speaker 1 (00:24):
Oh, yeah, definitely. Uhhuh, <affirmative>.

Speaker 2 (00:27):
Can somebody hear me? An example?

Speaker 1 (00:30):
Um, it's like a rule. Uh, you know, where people should follow. Sit up straight. I am sitting up straight. What are you talking about?

Speaker 2 (00:44):
Good. Before we, I just wanna talk about, um, one thing, and it's called respect. Okay. Does anyone know where, what respect is?

Speaker 1 (00:54):
Um,

Speaker 2 (00:58):
Family?

Speaker 1 (00:59):
Yeah. It's, um, being considerate of people around you.

Speaker 2 (01:04):
Yeah. Good. Um, yeah, so, oh, no, no, I think you got it right. Sorry. Um,

Speaker 1 (01:10):
No, no, no. I'm sorry. My mom is just texting, texting me. That's why I said that. I'm sorry. Um,

Speaker 2 (01:18):
No, that's okay. I

Speaker 1 (01:19):
Took your <laugh>. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:20):
Let's put our phones away for now, and then just talk about Gotcha. Respect for a second. So, mm-hmm. <affirmative>, our biggest, um, I don't wanna call it a rule because it sounds really, it sounds like I'm a dictator or something, but I just wanna talk about how important it is to respect others around you. So, earlier Emily said we should be considerate to each other, but mm-hmm. <affirmative>, we should also respect ourselves. Right? Will, are you okay?

Speaker 1 (01:46):
Definitely. Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I, oh, oh, man. I stayed up way too late last night. I was watching videos. I'm sorry. I'm here. I'm awake. I'm awake. I'm here.

Speaker 2 (01:57):
It's all good, man. So, um, like I said, so let's just be considerate to each other and respect yourselves too. Okay? So later on during the lesson

Speaker 2 (02:09):
If we ask.

Speaker 1 (02:13):
Okay. All

Speaker 2 (02:16):
Right. All right. So later on if I ask any questions, um, instead of just, um, saying it without raising our hands, let's, um, raise your hands if you wanna say something. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 1 (02:29):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (02:32):
Yeah, Jayla.

Speaker 1 (02:34):
Yeah, I was just thinking of a good, um, classroom norm or like, like a rule, which would be, um, you know, just kind of be ready to work when you get to class. You know, kind of have your homework out or, or, or whatever, you know, we're gonna be discussing and just kind of be ready to get started with the day.

Speaker 2 (02:51):
Yeah, absolutely. I think it's, I think that's a really good point. Does anyone else wanna add on to Jay's point?

Speaker 1 (03:00):
Uh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Um, what's up, Carlos? So we, um, I was just gonna say, I saw the first Ironman movie finally over the weekend, and I just wanted to tell everybody if I haven't seen it. You should. It's pretty good. I, I, I hate superheroes, but I don't anymore. Um, so you can thank Robert Downey Jr. For that. So that's all just

Speaker 2 (03:22):
Wanted share. Let's talk about that a little bit later.

Speaker 1 (03:25):
Okay? Okay. Gotcha. Gotcha.

Speaker 2 (03:28):
So, the last thing I wanna talk, what's up, Emily?

Speaker 1 (03:32):
Oh, I was just gonna make a suggestion for keep talking. Sorry. Oh, I was gonna say, we should be respectful of other people's like space. So, um, like, you know, running or no, like, you know, pushing people or taking things that aren't yours, baby. I don't know. Just some,

Speaker 2 (03:56):
I trust you guys enough to not do that anyway, but I'm glad you point pointed that out. Thank you. Okay. Okay. So one of my biggest, um, the one thing that I think is very, very homework is, let's not put each other down, but try to encourage each other all the time. Okay? Okay. Will do we

Speaker 1 (04:17):
Have any homework? Yeah, I'm sorry. I was just asking Mina, do we have any homework? We didn't have anything to do

Speaker 2 (04:22):
Today. Did. It's all good, man. I'll, I'll talk about homework and all that stuff later.

Speaker 1 (04:26):
Okay. <laugh>. Alright. All right. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (04:30):
No, you're good. All right. So what did I say earlier? Let's not put, what did I say? Let's not put it,

Speaker 1 (04:38):
This is, yeah, this is boring. Why are we doing this? Forget.

Speaker 2 (04:44):
Well, I mean, it's important to set rules and norms, like you said earlier, right? Before we get started with the No,

Speaker 1 (04:50):
You're right. Okay.

Speaker 2 (04:52):
Yeah. I understand know, it might be a little boring and dry, but this is something that we have. Right, right.

Speaker 1 (04:58):
I got it. Makes sense. Sorry about that.

Speaker 2 (05:01):
No, you're good, man. All right, so

Speaker 1 (05:06):
End simulation. All right.
