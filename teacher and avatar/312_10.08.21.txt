Speaker 1 (00:01):
Begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:05):
Hi everyone. How are you?

Speaker 1 (00:08):
Hi, teacher. Good,

Speaker 2 (00:11):
Good. Did everyone have a good vacation?

Speaker 3 (00:14):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2 (00:17):
Well, I'm excited to hear all about your Slater, but we need to remember our classroom norms. Does anyone remember?

Speaker 1 (00:24):
Oh, um, I think we had one. Um, or I think we should have one that we don't have any cell phones in the classroom.

Speaker 2 (00:32):
Yeah, I agree. We need to have our cell phones away in our backpack. That's a good one, Carlos. So I have three major ones that we're gonna go over again. You guys ready?

Speaker 3 (00:42):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

Speaker 2 (00:44):
Yeah. Okay. Number one. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Respect. So we need to respect our classroom space. That means we're not gonna

Speaker 3 (00:51):
Sit up. Oh,

Speaker 1 (00:53):
I'm sitting up.

Speaker 3 (00:55):
Yeah.

Speaker 2 (01:00):
Do you remember what I just said? So we need focus, respect, which brings into our active listening skills. Does anyone remember what active listening is? No.

Speaker 3 (01:13):
It's listen to teacher.

Speaker 2 (01:17):
Right? Good job, Emily. So active listening.

Speaker 3 (01:22):
Sending. So,

Speaker 2 (01:27):
Oh, that's okay. We can figure it out later. So remember, active listening is when we listen to our peers send

Speaker 3 (01:34):
Text.

Speaker 2 (01:36):
Oh, Evelyn, remember we said we have to put our phones away. Can you put your phone away please?

Speaker 3 (01:39):
Oops. Okay. Yes.

Speaker 2 (01:43):
Okay. So active listening is when we listen to our peers.

Speaker 1 (01:50):
I stayed up too late last night sleeping.

Speaker 2 (01:53):
You did well. Can you stay? And then we can talk about that later.

Speaker 3 (01:59):
Okay. Okay.

Speaker 2 (02:03):
Hey. Okay. Yeah. I know vacation is hard to come back, but we're at school now, so that's good. Okay.

Speaker 1 (02:08):
Hey Emily, are you gonna go to jump after school today? Emily. Jayla.

Speaker 2 (02:14):
Jayla.

Speaker 3 (02:15):
Um, yeah. Emily go the, I'm coming to your party

Speaker 2 (02:21):
Guys. We're Emily.

Speaker 1 (02:25):
Okay. Yeah. Sorry, teacher. Sounds

Speaker 2 (02:28):
Fun. That sounds fun. But we're in the school right now to focus on here. So remember we went over respect.

Speaker 1 (02:33):
I know,

Speaker 2 (02:34):
I know, right? Vacation's fun. But we're back in school. So we have respect, active listening, and then we need to stay in our fit. Oh, yes. Jayla.

Speaker 1 (02:44):
Oh, I had a norm.

Speaker 2 (02:45):
Oh, what's your norm?

Speaker 1 (02:48):
Um, everybody, um, needs to take turns talking. No interrupting.

Speaker 2 (02:56):
Yeah, that's a good idea. So that ties back into our class. Active listening. So everyone gets to talk and everyone gets to listen. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And then focus on what they're saying so they're able to respond when it's their turn. And then, so remember, I

Speaker 1 (03:11):
Thanks guys. I saw the Iron Man movies this somewhere. They were so good. Did anybody else see Iron Man? I saw them twice. Did you see it?

Speaker 2 (03:22):
I did not see it, but I'm so excited to hear about it later. Why don't we talk about it at recess when that's later on.

Speaker 1 (03:28):
Oh, okay. Okay, teacher.

Speaker 2 (03:30):
Great. So let's go back to our last one. The stay in our area seat and only use materials when instructed. Yes, Emily?

Speaker 3 (03:41):
Um, I have one. Yeah. I think that, um,

Speaker 1 (03:44):
Everybody should, um, like respect everybody else's space around them. Like what? Running and touching other people's stuff.

Speaker 2 (03:54):
That's a good, I I like your that norm. That's very good. Awesome. Thanks. Yeah. So does anyone have any other questions about norms or, I need to go over them again.

Speaker 1 (04:08):
Hey, Mina, did you, is our book report due today? I dunno if I, um, if I put it my backpack. I'm not sure. I dunno. Will did not book report. Did you do yours?

Speaker 2 (04:22):
Will, do you have a question?

Speaker 1 (04:26):
Oh, no, sorry. No.

Speaker 2 (04:29):
Okay. Well, if you ever have a question, remember raise your hand and then I will actively listen to your question and then respond.

Speaker 1 (04:40):
Oh, this is, this is boring. Why are we doing this again?

Speaker 2 (04:46):
Well, because we were on vacation, you guys might have forgotten how our classroom works.

Speaker 1 (04:51):
Yeah, okay.

Speaker 2 (04:54):
I know, I know. We'll do some more fun lessons later, but this is important.

Speaker 1 (05:00):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (05:02):
Let's see. Are there any other norms that we can think of? So we have respect, active listening. Oh,

Speaker 1 (05:10):
And simulation.
