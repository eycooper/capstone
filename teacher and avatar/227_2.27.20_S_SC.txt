Speaker 1 (00:01):
And start simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:07):
Hi class.

Speaker 1 (00:09):
Hi.

Speaker 2 (00:09):
Hi. Okay, so today we're gonna be going over the norms that we established in the classroom. Um, the first one that we said that we were gonna put in the classroom is to respect each other and to be kind. And so can someone gimme an example of that? Norm?

Speaker 1 (00:26):
I'm sorry. Uh, you said be respectful and

Speaker 2 (00:30):
Be kind. Yeah. Respect each other and be kind. Yeah.

Speaker 1 (00:34):
Um, I think maybe if people don steal other people's pencils, like Will here, I think that may might be a good place to start. I didn't sue your pencil or pen or ready your pencils. Okay.

Speaker 2 (00:48):
Nina.

Speaker 1 (00:49):
She did.

Speaker 2 (00:50):
Nina, I think that is a good example, but how about if there's something between you and Will? We can talk about that later. Is that okay?

Speaker 1 (00:58):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (00:58):
Okay. Yeah, that's, that's a good example, right? We don't wanna take each other's stuff. We wanna respect each other's stuff. Right.

Speaker 1 (01:06):
Sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:07):
You're okay. Are you okay, Emily?

Speaker 1 (01:09):
Yeah, I could just, I'll turn my phone off.

Speaker 2 (01:12):
Okay. Yes. If you could take, if you could put away your phone. Yeah. Yep. Okay. And then our second norm was listen and raise your hand if you wanna speak. Right. Um, what if Jayla was talking and Will and Emily were just, you know, talking to their neighbors? Is that okay?

Speaker 1 (01:31):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Mm-hmm. <affirmative> now?

Speaker 2 (01:32):
Yeah. Do you wanna listen to Distracting?

Speaker 1 (01:35):
Yeah.

Speaker 2 (01:35):
Distracting.

Speaker 1 (01:35):
Yeah. Oh, oh, oh. So I wanted to just mention, I wrote this really cool, um, short play about superheroes, um, and I wanted to see if anybody wanted to do a readthrough of it. Just sort of like workshopping a script.

Speaker 2 (01:48):
Carlos, that's awesome. But right now we're talking about our norms, so let's talk about that later. Is that okay?

Speaker 1 (01:56):
Okay. That's, that's

Speaker 2 (01:57):
Fine. Okay. Thank you. For sure. Okay. Um, so we, we established the first one. Respect each other and be kind. And the second yay

Speaker 1 (02:08):
Pen thief. I didn't do it. I didn't, I don't need a

Speaker 2 (02:11):
Pen. Nina will stop talking and please listen. Thank you. Okay. And so our third norm that we wanna go over is be safe. What does that look like in the classroom?

Speaker 1 (02:25):
Um, I think can't get back. Not running, not touching other people's things. Yeah. He's just respecting speaks. Yeah. Speaks of other people.

Speaker 2 (02:37):
Is it okay if we kind of like touch each other and push each other or do something? Oh, no. Physical. That's not okay. Right? That's not being safe, right?

Speaker 1 (02:44):
No. We're like playing tag or something.

Speaker 2 (02:47):
Do you wanna play tag inside the classroom? No. No. Right. Yeah. It could cause people to fall. You can run into desks, chairs, and then you guys could get hurt, right? Yep. Okay, so, so those are the three norms that we established. Can some of you maybe share what we

Speaker 1 (03:06):
Oh, oh, oh. Are you in charge of the science fair this year? Cause like someone told me that, that our teacher was, and I don't know who is, but I have like, so many good ideas. Carlos,

Speaker 2 (03:16):
We are talking about our norms right now, and we'll talk about the sides here later. I know you're excited so we can talk about it later. Okay. Cool. Cool. Okay, so like I said, can someone maybe tell us what we went over about the norms?

Speaker 1 (03:32):
Um, to be safe?

Speaker 2 (03:34):
Mm-hmm. <affirmative> and respectful. Yes. Be kind. Yes. And what was the second one that we talked about? About talking? Um,

Speaker 1 (03:42):
Don't interact.

Speaker 2 (03:42):
Yeah, you wanna listen and raise your hand, right? Yeah. Okay. So that's basically our norms for the classroom.
