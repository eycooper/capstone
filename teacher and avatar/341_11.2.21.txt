Speaker 1 (00:00):
It is time for your session to start. So begin simulation.

Speaker 2 (00:07):
Good morning class. I hope you all had a great vacation. Today we are going to review some classroom norms. So first I'm going to go over a few norms that I think would be good for the group. And I would like your feedback too, because they're not only my norms, they're also your norms, right? And then at the end, okay, if anyone has any suggestions for norms, you can share those with me too. Does that sound good? Okay. Yeah,

Speaker 1 (00:32):
Sounds great.

Speaker 2 (00:33):
Okay, so the first norm that I have is to respect yourself. Sit up others and those around you.

Speaker 1 (00:41):
I'm sitting

Speaker 2 (00:42):
Up, Nina, I'm

Speaker 1 (00:43):
Sitting up. Yeah, I'm sorry. Just, just thought will, wasn't paying, paying attention.

Speaker 2 (00:49):
So can you tell me the norm that I just went over?

Speaker 1 (00:54):
Um, to be respectful. I didn't quite hear you. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (00:57):
Yes. I said to respect yourself and others. And do you think that it's very respectful of space when you tell him what to do in a mean tone or mean way?

Speaker 1 (01:11):
No, no, no. Not at all. Sorry

Speaker 2 (01:13):
About that. It's not So that, that, sorry. That action that you just did doesn't really align with our norm that we were going over. Emily.

Speaker 1 (01:22):
Sorry, my mom is texting me. I think I got something at home. Sorry.

Speaker 2 (01:28):
Are you nervous?

Speaker 1 (01:31):
Is it Oh, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 2 (01:32):
It's an important phone call.

Speaker 1 (01:34):
No, it was just

Speaker 2 (01:35):
Something to talk to your mom. But if, yeah, it's, something's not really important right now. We need to focus on our norms because the idea of a norm is for us to be able to come to the classroom together to be able to learn. And if you're texting your mom, you're not really present in the moment or being able to learn with us in the moment. And learning these norms are really important for us to know how to interact with each other. Okay? Okay. Will, are you okay?

Speaker 1 (02:06):
Whoa, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I, I dozed off. I, I I think I stayed up too late last night. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm here. I'm

Speaker 2 (02:12):
Awake. I understand being tired in class can be hard, but remember we're trying to respect

Speaker 1 (02:18):
Come

Speaker 2 (02:19):
Yourself and others and that also birthday for me as your teacher, Jayla.

Speaker 1 (02:25):
Oh, sorry. I was just asking Emily if she was uh, gonna do something later. That's alright. Sorry, I'm here.

Speaker 2 (02:32):
Can you wait for your conversations to end when we're done with the norms? So I invited you all to be able to speak with me about the norms. So that means if you have something to say, you should say it to the entire group, not just a few people. Yes, Jayla.

Speaker 1 (02:46):
Okay. So, um, definitely I agree and, um, I have a, a norm to share, I guess like, you know, being, being, um, ready to go at the beginning of every class, like having done your homework and your reading and just kind of being ready to participate. So

Speaker 2 (03:03):
Yes, I agree. I think that's a great norm. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, it kind of aligns with one of the norms that I wrote down for us

Speaker 1 (03:09):
Was

Speaker 2 (03:10):
Dare yourself to try. So that means that you try and give your best effort, like you were just saying, Carlos. Yeah. Are you okay?

Speaker 1 (03:18):
I was gonna say, you know, I finally got around to seeing the first Ironman movie over the weekend and it was really great Carlos. Um, I don't know if anyone was into it, but

Speaker 2 (03:27):
It's great. So what was, so Jay's norm that she just went over was about being prepared for class? Yeah. And do you think Ironman's really preparing you for class right now?

Speaker 1 (03:37):
Um, I guess not. I guess I was just, you know, looking to share something, that's all. Yeah. So I'll stop. Gotcha.

Speaker 2 (03:44):
Okay, perfect. So now we're gonna go on to our next norm. So, so far we have to, to be prepared for class and we have to respect yourself, others, and the school. And then our next norm is going to be actively engaged and listen to one another and actively engage and listen to the teacher. So that means like for example, when Jla was just talking about her norm that she had Mina, we all listen to each other. Will do

Speaker 1 (04:11):
Today? No. Oh, I'm sorry. I was just asking Mina if we had anything due today, but then I just remembered that, um, we're just coming back to vacation, so my bad.

Speaker 2 (04:21):
Sorry. Yes, I understand coming back from vacation can be kind of difficult. That's why we're going over these norms. But if you have a question about if there's something due, you can always ask me or it's up on our assignment sheet on the board. Okay.

Speaker 1 (04:34):
Okay. Sure, sure. Sorry about that.

Speaker 2 (04:37):
It's okay. So next,

Speaker 1 (04:39):
This is boring. Why are we doing this? Why are we doing this?

Speaker 2 (04:42):
So remember, our norms are for us to be able to interact with each other and have the best classroom environment that we can have. So I understand it may be a little boring to go over the norms, but our norms are really important because things like respect for each other and coming prepared for class are going to ensure that we have the best time in class that we can while we're together. So we have to go over our norm. Makes sense? People have different norms.

Speaker 1 (05:11):
End.
